**Income Statement:**

In 2022, the General Department's net income was SDR 1,570 million, a decrease from the previous year's SDR 1,657 million. This decrease was offset by a substantial gain from the remeasurement of net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans, resulting in a total comprehensive income of SDR 3,085 million, down from SDR 4,812 million in 2021.

**Changes in Reserves:**

The General Resources Account saw an increase in retained earnings, rising from SDR 8,557 million in 2020 to SDR 13,692 million in 2022. This growth was driven by net income and other comprehensive income, including gains from remeasurement of retirement benefits.

The Investment Account's resources also increased, from SDR 10,764 million to SDR 12,832 million during the same period. However, the Special Disbursement Account maintained a zero balance throughout both years.

**Conclusion:**

The General Department experienced a decrease in net income but a significant gain from the remeasurement of retirement benefits, resulting in a lower total comprehensive income in 2022 compared to 2021. The General Resources Account and Investment Account both reported increases in retained earnings and resources, respectively, reflecting the overall financial stability and growth of the department.
