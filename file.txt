Report of Independent Auditors  
 
To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund  
 
Opinion  
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International 
Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30, 
2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves, 
retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes 
(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash 
flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board.  
 
Basis for Opinion  
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit 
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International 
Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant 
ethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United 
States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to 
continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting 
period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting 
process.  
 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
   
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and 
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material 
if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment 
made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  
 
In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: 
 
● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such 
procedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements.  
● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is 
expressed.   
● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.  
● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, 
that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related 
matters that we identified during the audit. 
 
Supplemental Information  
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a 
whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and 
for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are 
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The 
supplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to 
the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information 
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain 
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statementsthemselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the 
information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are 
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the fina ncial statements taken as a whole.

1.  Nature of operations 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international 
organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s 
fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the 
international monetary system. It does so in three ways: 
surveillance of the global economy and the economies of 
member countries; lending to  countries with balance of 
payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.  
The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the 
General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA); 
(ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA). 
1.1  General Resources Account 
The financial operations of the IMF with its members are 
primarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota 
subscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings 
and repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions 
and interest to lenders, and other operations. 
A core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial 
assistance to member countries experiencing actual or 
potential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of 
a member country, GRA resources are made available either 
under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright 
purchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by 
the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a 
member the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide 
resources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the 
relevant financing instrument.  
The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members 
with balance of payments problems expected to be resolved 
in the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility 
(EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of 
which would require structural and more comprehensive 
economic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member 
implements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the 
Executive Board. 
The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with 
very strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of 
policy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line 
(SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several 
innovative features, including revolving access. It has the 
same qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for 
members facing potential moderate short-term balance of 
payments needs arising due to capital account pressures. 
The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for 
members with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the 
qualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.  
The financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid 
Financing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing 
an urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or 
capacity for a full-fledged program. 
1.2  Investment Account 
The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are 
invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board 
provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth 
Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whichcapacity for a full-fledged program. 
1.2  Investment Account 
The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are 
invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board 
provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth 
Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which 
became effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two 
subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.  
The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred 
from the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales. 
With a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s 
balance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income 
Subaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights 
(SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate 
(see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the 
frequency and extent of negative returns and 
underperformance over an investment horizon of three to 
four years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the 
Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed-
Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a 
margin of 50 basis points.I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with 
SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial 
years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering 
the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the 
long-term real value of these assets.  
1.3  Special Disbursement Account 
The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second 
Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978). 
SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as 
specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and 
transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and 
transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the 
IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the 
mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income 
member countries. 
1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF 
The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights 
Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional 
Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s 
purposes. As the General Department does not have control 
over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented 
separately. 
The resources of the SDR Department are held separately 
from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or 
administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of 
the General Department (or vice versa), except that 
expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed 
by the SDR Department.  
The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are 
contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by 
the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the 
trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets 
of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to 
meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the 
operations of the General  Department. The General 
Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in 
conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in 
accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and 
relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic 
developments 
The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in 
global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis 
with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial 
assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency 
financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements 
and augmented existing lending arrangements to 
accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, 
and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased 
financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level. 
The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant 
uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth 
and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to furtherand 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased 
financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level. 
The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant 
uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth 
and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further 
demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to 
have a significant negative effect on global growth through 
commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war 
could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.  
The General Department continues to manage its risks in 
accordance with its existing risk management framework 
(see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements, 
there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment 
analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note 
2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in 
the preparation of thes e financial statements. 
The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have 
effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the 
global developments on the investment portfolios. The 
valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully 
and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the 
onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in 
Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp 
increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment 
portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions 
and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on 
investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see 
Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized 
cost was not impacted.I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement 
The financial statements of t he General Department are 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments 
at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements 
have also been prepared on t he basis that the General 
Department will continue to op erate as a going concern. 
2.1  Unit of account 
The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the 
IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined 
daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket 
currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition 
of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These 
reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of 
currencies), determine the relative weights of those 
currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are 
used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the 
currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30, 
2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows: 
SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount 
Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174 
Euro 30.93 0.38671 
Japanese yen 8.33 11.900 
Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946 
US dollar  41.73 0.58252 
 
At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430 
(US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021). 
The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled 
to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive 
Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022. 
On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the 
quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR 
and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR 
currency and interest rate baskets and approved their 
updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, 
accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, 
the euro, and the Japanese yen.  
Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket 
will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent) 
Chinese renminbi 12.28 
Euro 29.31 
Japanese yen 7.59 
Pound sterling 7.44 
US dollar  43.38 
 
The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated 
on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the 
new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of 
the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the 
interim justify an earlier review.  
2.2  SDR interest rate 
The SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges 
levied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR 
holdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’ 
reserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on 
borrowings (see Note 14).  
The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a 
weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments 
in the money markets of the members whose currencies are 
included in the SDR valuation basket:  
SDR basket currency Yield or rate 
Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China 
Treasury bonds as published by the China 
Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. 
Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central 
government bonds with a minimum rating of 
AA published by the European Central 
Bank 
Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills 
Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills 
US dollar Three-month Treasury bills 
 
The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent 
and is rounded to three decimal places.Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central 
government bonds with a minimum rating of 
AA published by the European Central 
Bank 
Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills 
Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills 
US dollar Three-month Treasury bills 
 
The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent 
and is rounded to three decimal places.  
The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum 
and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years 
ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
2.3  Use of estimates and judgement 
The preparation of financ ial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates areI. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised 
and in any future periods affected. 
The most significant estimates and judgements used in 
applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn 
commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value 
measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and 
8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3). 
3.  Summary of significant accounting policies 
3.1  Financial instruments  
Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7. 
Measurement at initial recognition 
Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. The General Department uses settlement 
date accounting for all financial instruments except for 
investments, which are accounted for using trade date 
accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best 
evidenced by the transaction amount.  
Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when 
the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the 
assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and 
either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all 
the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General 
Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department 
has not retained control.  
Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are 
extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged, 
canceled, or expires).  
Classification and subsequent measurement of 
financial assets 
A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial 
asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.  
Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual 
cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized 
cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is 
included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is 
recognized in the statements of income.  
Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual 
cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows 
represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial 
assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be 
measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment 
At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on 
a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL) 
associated with its financial assets at AC and with the 
undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The 
measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating 
a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is 
available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.  
If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they 
would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.  
Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interestavailable without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.  
If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they 
would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.  
Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest 
income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment 
allowance). 
Classification and subsequent measurement of 
financial liabilities 
Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.  
All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.  
3.2  Financial assets 
3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’ 
currencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in 
the form of account balances or non-interest-bearing 
promissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on 
demand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC.I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 15  Usable currencies are currencies of members considered 
to be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can 
be used to finance GRA transactions with other members.  
 Currencies of members that are not considered to have a 
sufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves 
position to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.  
 Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own 
currencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note 
3.2.1.1).  
The currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency 
revaluations (see Note 5). 
3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges 
Credit outstanding is a financial asset that represents 
financing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing 
in the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in 
exchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by 
members by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in 
exchange for SDRs or usable currencies.  
Charges and fees 
The GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on 
members’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method. 
 
In addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant 
level-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding 
set by the Executive Board are reached.  
Charges not received from members within the required 
timeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden-
sharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate 
of charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of 
remuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see 
Note 13.1).  
A service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from 
the GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized 
as income upon payment.  
A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for 
financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of 
the arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment 
fees are refunded as the member makes purchases under 
the relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also 
refunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are 
recognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of 
financial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment 
fee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly, 
commitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the duration of the SLL arrangement. 
Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of 
the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status: 
 
 The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.  
 IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic 
policies that the member commits to in order to overcome 
balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.  
 The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1). 
 The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which 
has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors. 
Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the 
likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses. The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1). 
 The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which 
has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors. 
Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the 
likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.  
The General Department has not recognized any impairment 
losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions 
in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to 
its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances 
varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk 
assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the 
General Department.  
Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit 
risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its 
unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not 
comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial 
financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization, 
the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating 
grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is 
assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative 
considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as 
the status of the economic programs underlying IMF 
financing, the member’s cooperation on policy 
implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s 
capacity to repay.I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL 
estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial 
recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1, 
Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk 
has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on 
a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been 
no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition 
(Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL 
that result from default events possible within the next 
12 months. 
The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the 
General Department in t he measurement of ECL are 
discussed below
: 
(i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired  
The General Department considers a member country to be 
in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its 
financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days 
past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the 
threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation 
has defaulted.  
(ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member 
basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date 
with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent 
disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is 
performed on each reporting date and takes into account a 
range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including 
overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by 
the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant 
increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for 
appropriateness at least annually.  
The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may, 
on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the 
presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due. 
During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted 
arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled 
(see Note 5.2). 
(iii) Low credit risk  
The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.  
Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet 
its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in 
the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the 
ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow 
obligations.  
(iv) Measuring ECL 
ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash 
shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate 
of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of 
possible outcomes in light of expected future economic 
conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of 
each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.  
For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and 
operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharingpossible outcomes in light of expected future economic 
conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of 
each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.  
For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and 
operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing 
mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to 
overdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special 
Contingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the 
ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2). 
Write-off 
In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding 
obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no 
prospects of recovering amounts due to the General 
Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would 
recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be 
written off.  
3.2.2  SDR holdings  
SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6). 
SDR holdings are measured at AC. 
Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective 
interest method.  
3.2.3  Investments  
Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private 
infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term 
investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in 
the statements of fi nancial position.I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in 
accordance with their respective investment strategy (see 
Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value 
basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities 
are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in 
accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in 
fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost. 
Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the 
trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable 
or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities, 
respectively, pending settlement of a transaction. 
Investment income compri ses interest income on 
investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising 
from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all 
trading-related fees. 
Interest income from investments is recognized using the 
effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized 
based on the ex-dividend date. 
3.3  Cash and cash equivalents  
Usable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows. 
3.4  Gold holdings 
Gold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of 
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at 
historical cost using the spec ific identification method. The 
carrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of 
the IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the 
sale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was 
held on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second 
Amendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion 
of the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in 
the GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount 
of the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold 
holdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to 
the historical cost. 
3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are 
measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the 
estimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other 
property, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold 
improvements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease 
agreement. Software is amortized over three to five years. 
3.6  Post-employment benefits 
The IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other 
post-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance 
benefits (see Note 11). 
The net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan 
recognized in the statements of financial position is the 
present value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair 
value of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive 
income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market 
yields on high-quality corporate bonds.  
Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net 
interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement 
benefit plans. 
3.7  Financial liabilities 
3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department todiscounting the estimated future cash outflows using market 
yields on high-quality corporate bonds.  
Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net 
interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement 
benefit plans. 
3.7  Financial liabilities 
3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to 
accumulate precautionary balances under the burden-
sharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit 
default. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.  
3.7.2  Borrowings  
Borrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing 
received under the various borrowing arrangements 
(see Note 14). 
Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the 
effective interest method.  
3.7.3  Quota subscriptions  
Members’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that 
represent subscription payments by members, including 
payments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member 
becomes effective when the member both consents to the 
quota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific 
quota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a 
quarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination ofI. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the 
member’s own currency.  
Quota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the 
statements of financial position, as they embody an 
unconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s 
withdrawal from the IMF. 
3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration 
A member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in 
exchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s 
currency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see 
Note 15.2).  
The GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a 
remunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche 
position (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized 
on an accrual basis.  
3.8  Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at 
the present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be 
paid to settle the obligations. 
3.9  Foreign currency translation 
Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are 
recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the 
transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the 
date of the financial statements. Exchange differences 
arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different 
from those at the originating date of the transactions are 
included in the determination of net income. 
3.10  Fair value measurement 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value 
measurement is based on th e presumption that the 
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market. 
A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair 
value under which financial instruments are categorized 
based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset

within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is 
based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair 
value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a 
Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are

4.  Financial risk management  
The General Department is exposed to various types of 
operational and financial risks, including credit, market, and 
liquidity risks. 
4.1  Risk management framework 
By virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of 
Agreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk 
acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and 
assessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management. 
 Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by 
establishing and main taining a system of internal controls. 
 A risk management function is responsible for developing 
and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and 
reporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile, 
highlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.  
 An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of 
governance and internal control processes.  
 Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor 
and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the 
cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.  
4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than 
investments 
Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are 
exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than 
investments 
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any 
of the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and 
undrawn committed amounts under approved financing 
commitments. 
Credit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the 
international monetary system  because the IMF has limited 
ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides 
financing when other sources of credit are not available to a 
member. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance 
provided to its member countries. 
Measures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing 
arrangements include program design and conditionality, 
which serve to help member countries solve their balance of 
payments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the 
member will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments, 
surcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for 
dealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden-
sharing mechanism (see Note 13).  
The IMF has established limits on overall access to 
resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to 
SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally 
set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative 
limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduledsharing mechanism (see Note 13).  
The IMF has established limits on overall access to 
resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to 
SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally 
set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative 
limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled 
repurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual 
limit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota 
annually for the period from July 13, 2020, through 
December 31, 2021.  
Access in excess of these limits can be granted in 
exceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements, 
there is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in 
accordance with the policy framework on exceptional access. 
The IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of 
payments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its 
ability to regain access to financing from other sources, the 
member’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of 
policies to be adopted.  
PLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of 
500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access 
under a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of 
125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience 
larger short-term balance of payments needs due to theI. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional 
or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL 
arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of 
quota. 
SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple 
purchases and repurchases may take place during the 
course of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent 
of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.  
Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy 
safeguards when a member requests financing with 
combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified 
thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that 
trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework. 
The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and 
procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access 
framework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to 
September 2020. 
The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50 
percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100 
percent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases). 
These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of 
quota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of 
scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020, 
through June 30, 2023. 
Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in 
tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural 
benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by 
the Executive Board.  
In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to 
mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance 
against any conditions under an IMF-supported program. 
Safeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance 
that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control, 
reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including 
IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as 
direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at 
the central bank, and that an appropriate framework 
agreement between the central bank and the government be 
in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial 
obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.  
The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.  
4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding 
Credit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and 
SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively 
(see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by 
region was as follows:
 
 
The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as 
follows: 
 
The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine, 
Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is 
presented in Schedule 1. 
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number 
of countries have benefited from emergency financial 
assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21 
countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million 
that did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March 
31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.

4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments 
Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted 
to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30, 
2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in

 21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the 
Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022 
(SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).  
The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have 
also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see 
Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries 
that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit 
outstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented 
existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new 
needs arising from the impact of the pandemic. 
4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than 
investments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows 
of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and 
exchange rate risk. 
4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will 
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments 
of the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR 
interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate 
(see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by 
linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR 
interest rate).  
4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk 
Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s 
financial position and cash flows will be affected by 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  
 The General Department has no exchange rate risk 
exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such 
holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).  
 The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes 
administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these 
activities is limited.  
 The General Department has no exchange rate exposure 
from its current borrowing arrangements because all 
drawings are denominated in SDRs. 
4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments 
Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of 
nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of 
members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF 
financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a 
revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of 
credit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand 
ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for 
example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of 
need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s 
reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New 
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing 
agreements (see Note 14). 
The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing 
developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity 
measure—Forward Commitment Capacity
-represents the 
IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its 
members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).  
Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the 
adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of 
members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to 
evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet 
members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14). 
Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewedLong-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the 
adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of 
members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to 
evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet 
members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14). 
Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed 
and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis 
through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and 
the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.  
4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other 
than investments 
Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase 
periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled 
and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are 
summarized below: 
 
 
Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined 
according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was

Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, 
and 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively. 
These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than 
scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively. 
Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the 
SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total 
of SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date. 
Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates. 
4.3  Investments 
Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 
4.3.1  Credit risk on investments 
Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if 
issuers and counterparties were to default on their 
contractual obligations.  
Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income 
investments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the 
time of acquisition: 
 For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12, 
2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of 
BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale) 
for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).  
 For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for 
corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate 
bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB– 
are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the 
Investment Account. 
 Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments 
issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), 
which does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits, 
and short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit 
risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the 
end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows: 
 Fixed-Income Subaccount  
 April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021

fixed-income instruments)

Total  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0% 
 
 
Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and 
collateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk 
for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized 
gains on such contracts.  
The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the 
Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and 
SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The 
credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and 
SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
4.3.2  Market risk on investments 
Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows 
of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest 
rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks. 
The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and 
Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment 
strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are 
tailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them

 23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount 
The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a 
broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and 
Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class 
diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.  
The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of 
derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio 
balancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage. 
Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments 
denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income 
Subaccount’s SDR basket composition. 
4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount  
Investments are divided into eight categories, which are 
subject to varying market risks and benefits from 
diversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible 
investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class 
diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.  
Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to 
emerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed 
passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment 
Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation 
and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up 
to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same 
asset categories with target  shares for fixed-income 
instruments and equities with out specific allocation 
requirements within those shares).  
The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative 
instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing, 
benchmark replication, and market access.  
Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in 
US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general 
objective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see 
Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is 
measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations 
of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk 
for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed 
market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.  
4.3.2.3  Value at risk 
Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which 
considers known market risks in each of the asset categories 
and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates 
reported below represent the maximum potential loss in 
value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market 
movements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a 
1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount. 
The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a 
three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios 
to produce plausible future scenarios based on these 
simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations 
and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical 
empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard 
methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves manysimulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations 
and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical 
empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard 
methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many 
assumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different 
assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.

4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments 
Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an investment will not have an active buyer or seller when 
traded, which could negatively affect the price of the 
investment. 
The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is 
minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their resources in readily marketable short-term investments. 4.3.3.1  Maturity profile of investments The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives 
in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:

Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid 
investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity, 
whenever necessary. 
4.4  Post-employment benefit plans 
The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity, and longevity risks associated wit h post-employment benefit 
plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced a gainst the need 
to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset 
allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the 
Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is 
designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk 
(volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning 
portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’ 
liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment 
approach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of 
return, because asset class returns are not perfectly 
correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific, 
targeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategiesI. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or 
duration matching. 
The primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have 
sufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the 
participants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings 
of cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans. 
4.5  Precautionary balances 
Precautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the 
2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the 
Endowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1. 
They are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk 
management framework as they provide a buffer to protect 
the Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit, 
income, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of 
precautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the 
standard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring 
due to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy 
linked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive 
Board kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum 
floor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative 
target had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion 
during the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020). 
During the December 2021 interim review, the Executive 
Board approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary 
balances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic 
and financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as 
the ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans 
is measured using a discount rate that reflects the
 expected 
long-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability 
calculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net 
asset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect 
from May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date, 
reflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.  
At April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances 
amounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion, 
respectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021

1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis 
resulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to 
precautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19. 
5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding 
Under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are 
required to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their 
currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or 
appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives 
rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of 
the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMFrequired to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their 
currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or 
appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives 
rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of 
the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF 
or the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at 
April 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising 
from those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and 
SDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of 
SDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables 
and payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million, 
respectively). 
All holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at 
the IMF’s financial year-end.  
5.1  Credit outstanding 
At April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit 
was represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million 
and SDR 89,788 million, respectively.I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of 
the GRA were as follows: 
1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary 
Financing Facility. 
 
1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary 
Financing Facility. 
 
5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance 
The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI 
that was provided by the General Department to members 
facing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit 
outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1. 
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access 
limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see 
Note 4.2.1). 
5.1.2  Impairment analysis 
The General Department has performed an impairment 
analysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL 
model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss 
allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022, 
and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding 
takes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing 
and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for 
each debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative 
considerations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the 
results of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and 
2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in 
input parameters of the ECL calculation. 
5.2  Overdue obligations 
At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General 
Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more 
overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).  
On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue 
obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and 
SDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue 
charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected 
through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and 
remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).  
6.  SDR holdings 
The General Department can receive SDRs from members in 
the settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and 
quota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use 
or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to 
members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on 
borrowings to member countries and lenders. 
At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General 
Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and 
SDR 22,203 million, respectively. 
The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate 
as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during 
the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million, 
respectively.

 27 During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, 
SDR 2,393 million was transferred from the GRA to the IA, as 
approved by the Executiv e Board (SDR 319 million 
transferred from the IA to the GRA during the financial year 
ended April 30, 2021). 
On January 12, 2022, the Executive Board reviewed the 
strategy of the Investm ent Account and approved 
refinements to the investment strategies of the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount, as reflected in Notes 1.2, 4.3.1, 4. 3.2, 7.1, and 7.2. Im plementation of these 
changes has been initiated, but will be completed during the year ending April 30, 2023. 
7.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount  
The Fixed-Income Subaccount comprises two tranches, a 
shorter-duration Tranche 1 and a longer-duration Tranche 2. 
Effective January 12, 2022, the average duration of the 
Fixed-Income Subaccount should not exceed three years 
(prior to January 12, 2022, the Fixed-Income Subaccount 
had an average duration limit of two and a half years with 
Tranche 1 managed against a zero- to three-year 
government bond benchmark index and Tranche 2 against a zero- to five-year government bond benchmark index). 
Tranche 1 is managed actively, while Tranche 2 is managed 
according to a buy-and-hold investment approach, which in limited circumstances allows for the sale of investments in 
accordance with the overall in vestment strategy prior to 
maturity. Tranche 2 was phased in over a five-year period, which concluded in 2021. Prior to completion, assets pending 
investment in Tranche 2 were placed in fixed term deposits. 
Both tranches can be invested in debt obligations issued by 
national governments of member s, their central banks and 
official agencies, international financial institutions, and obligations of the BIS, denomi nated in SDRs or currencies 
included in the SDR basket, referred to as Group 1 assets for investment management purposes . Eligible investments in 
Tranche 1 also include fixed-income securities issued by 
subnational governments, corporate bonds, 
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and cash instruments with maturities  of one year or less, referred 
to as Group 2 assets for investment management purposes. Assets are being invested by external managers, except for investments with the BIS and short-term investments 
(residual cash balances). Effective January 12, 2022, Group 2 assets should not exceed 40 percent of the Fixed-Income 
Subaccount portfolio (35 percent before January 12, 2022).

7.2  Endowment Subaccount  
The assets of the Endowment Subaccount are invested in a 
globally diversified portfolio consisting of fixed-income and equity instruments (including REITs), and private 
infrastructure debt. Assets are invested by external 
managers, except for short-term investments (residual cash balances).  
The Endowment Subaccount is invested in accordance with 
the strategic asset allocation in  select investment categories 
approved by the Executive Board.  Each investment category 
is invested to achieve exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.  
The refinements to the investm ent strategy approved by the 
Executive Board on January 12, 2022, modified the strategic 
asset allocation by reorganizing some investment categories 
and shifting the allocations between the categories including: 
(i) a reduction in the allocation to government bonds; (ii) a reduction in inflation-linked bonds; (iii) a dedicated allocation 
to infrastructure equities; and (iv) an increase in REITS. 
The strategic asset allocation includes a 5 percent allocation 
to private infrastructure debt. The IMF invests in this asset 
class through commingled funds and its commitments are 
drawn down over time based on notices from the respective 
investment managers. At Apr il 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021, 
total original commitments amounted to SDR 171 million. 
During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, total capital 
calls under the commitments totaled SDR 96 million and 
distributions amounting to SDR 1 million were paid back to the General Department (SDR 14 million and SDR 1 million 
for capital calls and distributions, respectively, during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). Investments in the Endowment Subaccount, all of which are classified as FVPL, consisted of the following investment

8.  Fair value measurement  
Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments 
include the following: 
Level 1 
The fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on 
quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets 
without any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and 
derivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income 
securities). These investments are included within Level 1 of 
the fair value hierarchy.  
Level 2 The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of 
significant observable market information, such  as recently 
executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable 
issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into 
account the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable, 
these securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value 
hierarchy.  
The fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments 
(foreign exchange forwards, curr ency/interest rate swaps) not 
actively traded is determined using a pricing model that 
incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves. Given that  the significant inputs into the 
pricing models are market obser vable, these instruments are 
included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Level 3 
The private infrastructure debt assets classified within Level 
3 have significant unobserva ble inputs, as they trade 
infrequently or do not trade at all. As observable prices are 
not available for these assets, the mark-to-model valuation 
technique is used to derive the fair value. Different assumptions or approximations could produce significantly 
different valuation estimates.

During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments totaling SDR 11 million in the Endowment Subaccount were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (there were no transfers 
from Level 1 to Level 2 in the Fixed-Income Subaccount). 
These investments relate to equity securities where trading was either inactive or quoted prices in the applicable market 
were not observable as at April 30, 2022. Quoted prices for 
similar securities directly observable in an alternative market 
were used for fair value measurement of these securities as 
at April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 in both 
the Fixed-Income and Endowment Subaccounts.   
There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 of fair value 
hierarchy in both the Fixed-Income and Endowment

30 Fixed-term deposits in the IA are generally of a short-term 
nature and are carried at amorti zed cost, which approximates 
fair value. 
Derivative liabilities at April 30, 2022 comprised 
SDR 16 million valued based on quoted market prices 
(Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and SDR 76 million 
valued based on observable market data (Level 2 in the fair 
value hierarchy) (SDR 8 million and SDR 48 million for 
Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, at April 30, 2021). 
8.2  Credit outstanding  
The IMF plays a unique role in providing balance of 
payments support to member countries. IMF financing 
features policy conditions that  require member countries to 
implement macroeconomic and structural policies and are an 
integral part of IMF financing. These measures aim to help 
countries resolve their balanc e of payments problems while 
safeguarding IMF resources. The fair value of IMF credit 
outstanding cannot be deter mined due to its unique 
characteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, and the absence of a principal or 
most advantageous market for IMF credit.  
8.3  Other financial assets and liabilities  
The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities that 
are classified at AC represents a reasonable estimate of their 
fair value at April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
9.  Gold holdings  
The IMF acquired its gold holdings from quota subscriptions and financial transactions prior to the entry into force of the 
Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement 
(April 1, 1978). At April 30,  2022, and 2021, the IMF held 
gold of 2,814 metric tons, equal to 90.474 million fine troy ounces, at designated depositories. Gold holdings were valued at a historical cost of SDR 3,167 million at April 30, 
2022, and 2021, based on a cost of SDR 35 per fine troy ounce. 
At April 30, 2022, the market value of the IMF’s holdings of 
gold was SDR 128.6 billion (SDR 111.4 billion at 
April 30, 2021).  
10.  Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of 
depreciation and amortization, amounted to SDR 551 million and SDR 555 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, 
respectively, and consisted of land, buildings, equipment, 
furniture, and software.

11.  Employee benefits 
11.1  Overview of the Plans 
The IMF has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) that covers all eligible staff and a Supplemental Retirement 
Benefits Plan (SRBP) for a subset of participants of the SRP. 
The SRBP provides for the payment of benefits that 
otherwise would have been payable had the US qualified 
plan benefits and compensation limits not applied. Participants in the SRP and SRBP (the pension plans) are 
entitled to unreduced annual pensions beginning at the 
normal retirement age of 62 or earlier if certain conditions of 
age and service are met. The mandatory retirement age is  Land Buildings Other Total

 31 65. The pension plans also provide an option for eligible staff 
to receive reduced pension be nefits beginning at the age of 
50. The level of pension benefits depends on the participants’ length of service and highest three-year average pensionable gross compensation. Participants may also elect upon 
retirement to commute a portion of the lifetime pension 
benefits into a lump-sum payment. 
On June 3, 2021, the Executiv e Board approved changes to 
the SRP and SRBP with an effect ive date of May 1, 2022, to 
update the formula for the co mputation of the pensionable 
gross compensation. The amount of past service cost 
resulting from these changes recognized in the statement of income for the year ended April 30, 2022, amounted to 
negative SDR 57 million.  
The IMF provides other non-pension long-term benefits, 
including medical insurance, life insurance, separation and 
repatriation benefits, accrued annual leave, and associated 
tax allowances. The IMF has established a separate account, the Retired Staff Benefits Investment Account (RSBIA), to 
hold and invest resources set asid e to fund the cost of certain 
post-retirement benefits.  
In May 2020, the Executive Board approved changes to 
separation and repatriation benef its with an effective date of 
October 1, 2020. The past servic e cost resulting from these 
changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year 
ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 6 million. In April 2022, the Executive Board ap proved changes to medical 
benefits covered by the RSBI A with an effective date of 
January 1, 2023. The past service cost resulting from these changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year 
ended April 30, 2022 was a gain of SDR 112 million. 
The assets in the SRP, SRBP, and RSBIA (collectively, the 
Plans) are held separately from  the assets of all other 
accounts of the IMF. Also, the net asset position in one of the 
Plans cannot be netted with the net liability position in 
another Plan. In the event the IMF were to exercise its right 
to terminate the Plans, the assets of these plans would be used to satisfy liabilities to par ticipants, retired participants, 
and their beneficiaries and other liabilities of the pension plans. Any remaining assets would be returned to the GRA. The GRA meets the costs of administering the Plans, and the 
SRP and RSBIA reimburse the GRA for investment-related 
costs.  
The Executive Board and t he Pension Committee are 
responsible for the governance of the Plans. The Executive 
Board approves the funding framework and amendments to 
the Plans. The Pension Committ ee, consisting of members of 
the Executive Board a nd senior staff, super vises and controls 
the overall administration of  the SRP and the SRBP. The 
Pension Committee also undert akes periodic valuations of the assets and liabilities related to the Plans and advises the 
Executive Board on the appropri ate funding framework. It is 
supported by an Investment Committee to oversee the investments of the Plans.

Participants in the pension plans contribute a fixed 7 percent 
of pensionable gross compensation. The actuarially 
determined employer contributions to the pension plans 
during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 amounted to 10.66 percent of pensionable gross compensation 
(13.06 percent of pensionable gross compensation during the 
financial year ended April 30, 2021). Under the IMF’s funding 
framework, the budgetary allocations for payments to the 
pension plans have been set at 14 percent of pensionable gross compensation. The IMF expects to contribute 
SDR 150 million to the Plans during the financial year ending 
April 30, 2023.

11.3  Principal actuarial assumptions 
The IMF conducts a comprehensive analysis of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans every five 
years and reviews their applicability on an annual basis. The 
most recent five-year analysis was completed in April 2021.  
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial 
valuation were as follows: 
 April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021 
 (in percent)  
Discount rate/expected return on 
plan assets 4.18 3.02 
Rate of salary increases (average)  3.50 
Health care cost trend rate  4.00–6.50 4.00–6.75 
Inflation  2.00 
Life expectancy: (in years) 
Male  89.6 89.5 
Female  93.0 92.9 
 
The assumed retirement rate ranges from 5 percent at age 
50 to 100 percent at age 65, and the assumed participation 
rate for medical benefits upon retirement is 85 percent. 
The weighted average dura tion of the defined benefit 
obligation was 15.8 years at Ap ril 30, 2022 (19.1 years at 
April 30, 2021).

The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in one 
assumption, while holding all other assumptions constant, so that the effects of correlati on between the assumptions are 
excluded.

13.  Burden-sharing and the Special Contingent 
Account 
13.1  Burden-sharing for deferred charges  
The IMF has adopted a burden-sharing mechanism to 
address the financial consequences of member countries’ 
failure to settle financial obligations to the GRA on time. 
Under the burden-sharing mechanism, resources are generated by increasing the rate of charge paid by borrowers 
and reducing the rate of remuneration paid to creditor 
members to cover shortfalls in the GRA’s income due to the 
nonpayment of charges.  
Members that participated in  burden-sharing for overdue 
charges receive refunds to the extent that t hese charges are 
subsequently settled by the defaulting member. During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the General 
Department refunded the full amount of remaining burden-
sharing adjustments amounting to SDR 611 million resulting 
from the settlement of all outstanding overdue GRA charges 
previously deferred (see Note 5.2). There were no deferred charges at April 30, 2022. 
There were no burden-sharing refunds during the financial 
year ended April 30, 2021. Overdue charges that resulted in 
adjustments to charges and remuneration for the year ended 
April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see Note 17). Cumulative overdue charges that resulted in adjustments to 
charges and remuneration since May 1, 1986 (the date the 
burden-sharing mechanism was adopted) amounted to SDR 2,051 million at April 30, 2021. The cumulative refunds 
for the same period, resulting from the settlements of 
overdue charges for which burden-sharing adjustments had 
been made, amounted to SDR 1,440 million at 
April 30, 2021.  
13.2  Burden-sharing for the SCA-1 
The burden-sharing mechanism has also financed additions 
to the SCA-1, which offers protection against the risk of loss 
resulting from the ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA.  
Contributions to the SCA-1 are to be returned when there are 
no outstanding overdue repurchases and charges, or at such earlier time as the Executive Board may decide. 
During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, in connection 
with the clearance of Sudan’ s arrears to the IMF, the 
Executive Board decided to make a distribution of the remaining SDR 1,066 million in the SCA-1 to contributing members. The distribution took place on June 29, 2021, andno outstanding overdue repurchases and charges, or at such earlier time as the Executive Board may decide. 
During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, in connection 
with the clearance of Sudan’ s arrears to the IMF, the 
Executive Board decided to make a distribution of the remaining SDR 1,066 million in the SCA-1 to contributing members. The distribution took place on June 29, 2021, and 
the SCA-1 balance amounted to zero at April 30, 2022 
(SDR 1,066 million at April 30, 2021).I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
34 Effective November 1, 2006, t he Executive Board decided to 
suspend, for the time being, further additions to the SCA-1. 
Accordingly, no additions have been made to the SCA-1 
during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  
14.  Borrowings 
The GRA can borrow to temporarily supplement its quota 
resources. The Executive Boar d has established guidelines 
on borrowing by the GRA to ensur e that the financing of the 
GRA is managed in a prudent and systemic manner.  
The GRA’s main standing borrowing arrangement is the 
NAB. The GRA may also borrow under bilateral agreements, in particular loan and note purchase agreements (bilateral 
borrowing agreements). At April 30, 2022, the NAB credit 
arrangements amounted to SDR 360.8 billion and the bilateral borrowing agreements amounted to 
SDR 138.1 billion; see Schedules 4 and 5, respectively. 
14.1  New Arrangements to Borrow  
The NAB is a standing set of credit arrangements with 40 participants, of which 38 ag reements were effective at 
April 30, 2022, and 2021. The NAB provides supplementary 
resources to the GRA as a second line of defense to IMF 
quotas.  
NAB periods are renewed periodically. In January 2020, the 
Executive Board approved a NAB reform that doubled NAB 
commitments and set a new NAB period through end 2025. 
NAB participants have since provided the necessary consents and this reform took effect as targeted on January 
1, 2021. Following the effect iveness of the reform, the 
effective NAB commitments amounted to 360.8 billion at April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
NAB resources can be activated when the Fund’s resources 
need to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an 
impairment of the internat ional monetary system. The 
activation requires the consent of participants representing 
85 percent of total NAB credit  arrangements of participants 
eligible to vote and the approval  of the Executive Board. The 
NAB was not activated at April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
Drawings under the NAB can be made to finance purchases 
by borrowing members for outright purchases and under 
arrangements that were approved during the period when the NAB was activated. Claims under the NAB are encashable 
on demand by participants, subject to certain conditions. 
14.2  Bilateral Borrowing Agreements  
Bilateral borrowing agreements are intended to serve as a third line of defense to IMF quotas and NAB resources. The 
current round of bilateral borrowing agreements, which have been in effect since January 1, 2021, were signed under a framework established by the Executive Board in 2020. They 
have an initial term through end-December 2023, which may 
be extended by one more year, subject to creditor consent.  
At April 30, 2022, lenders’  commitments under effective 
borrowing agreements totaled US$185.6 billion, equivalent to 
SDR 138.1 billion (US$193.9 billion equivalent to 
SDR 135.0 billion at April 30, 2021).  
Resources under bilateral borrowing agreements can be 
activated only if the amount  of IMF resources otherwise 
available for financing has fallen below a threshold of SDR 100 billion and either the NAB is activated or there are no available uncommitted NAB resources. Activation requires 
approval by bilateral creditors r epresenting 85 percent of the 
total credit amount committed.  
Drawings under the borrowing agreements may be made to 
finance purchases by borrowing members for outright 
purchases and under arrangements that were approved during the period when the borrowing agreements were 
activated. Claims under the bilateral borrowing agreements 
are encashable on demand by lenders, subject to certain conditions. 
14.3  Outstanding borrowings 
Outstanding borrowings represent  drawings under the NAB, 
are denominated in SDRs, and carry the SDR interest rate. There were no outstanding borrowings under bilateralactivated. Claims under the bilateral borrowing agreements 
are encashable on demand by lenders, subject to certain conditions. 
14.3  Outstanding borrowings 
Outstanding borrowings represent  drawings under the NAB, 
are denominated in SDRs, and carry the SDR interest rate. There were no outstanding borrowings under bilateral 
borrowing agreements at April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
There were no drawings under the NAB or bilateral 
borrowings during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, 
and 2021. Repayments under the NAB during the same periods amounted to SDR 2,523 million and 
SDR 3,765 million, respectively. Total outstanding NAB 
borrowings at April 30, 2022, and 2021, were SDR 2,615 
million and SDR 5,138 million, respectively (see Schedule 4).  
The average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 
0.107 percent per annum and 0.077 percent per annum for 
the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, 
respectively.  The interest expense on outstanding borrowings 
during the same periods was SDR 4 million and 
SDR 6 million, respectively. 
15.  Quota subscriptions and reserve tranche 
positions 
15.1  Quota subscriptions 
The IMF’s resources are primarily provided by its members 
through the payment of quota subscriptions, which broadlyI. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 35 reflect each member’s relative position in the global 
economy. Quotas also determine each member’s relative 
voting power, its share in SDR allocations, and its access to 
IMF resources.  
The IMF conducts a general review of members’ quotas at 
intervals of not more than five years. The review allows the 
IMF to assess the adequacy of quota resources to meet its 
needs and to allow for adjustments to members’ quotas to 
reflect their relative positions in the world economy.  
The Fourteenth General Review of Quotas became effective 
in January 2016. At April 30, 2022, 187 members had 
consented and paid in full their quota increases, amounting to SDR 238 billion (184 members at April 30, 2021, 
amounting to SDR 238 billion) . This amount represents over 
99 percent of the total quota increases that members were 
eligible for at January 26, 2016 (SDR 239 billion). Quota subscription payments under the Fourteenth General Review 
of Quotas during the years e nded April 30, 2022, and 2021, 
amounted to SDR 0.5 billion and SDR 2 million, respectively. 
The Fifteenth General Review of  Quotas was concluded in 
February 2020 with no increase in IMF quotas. The Sixteenth 
Review is planned to be concluded no later than 
December 15, 2023. 
On October 16, 2020, the Princi pality of Andorra became the 
190
th member of the IMF wit h an initial quota of 
SDR 83 million, which was paid in full during the financial 
year ended April 30, 2021. 
15.2  Reserve tranche positions 
The reserve tranche is determined as the difference between the member’s quota subscription and the GRA’s holdings of its currency, excluding holdings that reflect the member’s use 
of GRA credit and administrative balances. A member’s 
reserve tranche is also considered a part of its international 
reserves and a liquid claim against the GRA that can be 
encashed by the member at any time upon the representation of a balance of payments need. 
 
Members’ reserve tranche positions were as follows:  
 April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 
 (in millions of SDRs ) 
Quota subscriptions 476,272 475,808

16.  Reserves of the General Resources Account 
16.1  Reserves of the General Resources Account 
The GRA reserves consist of the Special Reserve and the 
General Reserve. The General Reserve may be used inter 
alia to meet capital losses and operational deficits or for 
distribution to IMF members. The Special Reserve can be 
used for the same purposes except distribution to members. At April 30, 2022, the balanc es of Special and General 
Reserves amounted to SDR 13,692 million and SDR 12,832 million, respectively (SDR 11,347 million and SDR 12,003 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021).  
16.2  Income disposition 
The Executive Board determines annually what part of the GRA net income (as described below) will be placed to the General Reserve and/or the Special Reserve, and what part, 
if any, will be distributed. Net losses are charged against the 
Special Reserve in accordance with an Executive Board 
decision.  
The GRA net income/losses for the purpose of the income 
disposition includes: (i) total income of the GRA; (ii) transfer 
from the IA as approved by the Executive Board; and (iii) the 
remeasurement of net assets/ liabilities under retirement 
benefit plans. For the financia l years ended April 30, 2022, 
and 2021, the Executive Board decided to place income to/charge losses against reserves as follows:

17.  Charges and fees  
The average credit outstanding subject to charges amounted 
to SDR 90,522 million and SDR 86,700 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  
The rate of charge levied on outstanding credit is equal to the 
basic rate of charge adjusted for burden-sharing (see 
Note 13). The basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate 
plus a fixed margin as determined by the Executive Board, which for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, 
amounted to 100 basis points. The average rate of charge 
(adjusted for burden-sharing) was 1.107 percent per annum 
and 1.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended 
April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
Credit outstanding in excess of 187.5 percent of quota 
resulting from purchases in the credit tranches and under the 
EFF and the SLL is subject to a level-based surcharge of 
200 basis points per annum above the basic rate of charge. 
An additional time-based surcharge of 100 basis points per 
annum applies to such credit outstanding for more than three years, except for purchases under the EFF, for which the 
additional surcharge of 100 basis points applies after 51 months. Purchases under the SLL are not subject to time-based surcharges given the short maturity of repurchase 
obligations.  Charges income consisted of the following: 
 
During the year ended April 30, 2022, the IMF did not have 
overdue charges to defer. The deferred charges during the 
year ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see 
Note 13.1) and were fully recovered through the proceeds from burden-sharing adjustments to charges and 
remuneration of SDR 1 million each (see also Note 18). 
 Other charges and fees cons isted of the following: 
 2022  2021 
 (in millions of SDRs) 
Service charges  71 115 
Commitment fee 283 70 
Special charges 88 — 
Total charges  442 185 
 
A service charge of 50 basis points is levied by the GRA on 
all purchases from the GRA, except for purchases under SLL arrangements, which are subject to a service charge of 
21 basis points, and reserve tranche purchases, which are 
not subject to service charges.  
A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for 
financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period 
and refunded as the member makes purchases under the 
arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, the commitment 
fee amounts to 15 basis points per annum for access up to 115 percent of quota, 30 basis points for access between 
115 and 575 percent of quota, and 60 basis points for access 
in excess of 575 percent of quota. For SLL arrangements, 
the commitment fee amounts to 8 basis points and is not 
refundable when the member makes purchases under the 
arrangement. At the expiration or cancellation of a GRA arrangement any unrefunded amount is recognized as 
income, except for SLL arrangements for which commitment 
fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis during the 
duration of the arrangement. 
The GRA levies special charges on overdue repurchases 
and charges of less than six mont hs’ duration. Currently, the 
special rate of charge on overdue repurchases is set at zero and for overdue charges it is equal to the SDR interest rate. Such charges are deferred when not paid and recognized as  2022  2021

April 30, 2022, comprised previously deferred special 
charges paid by Sudan at the ti me of its arrears clearance 
(see Note 5.2). 
18.  Remuneration of members’ reserve tranche 
positions  
Remuneration of members’ reserve tranche positions 
amounted to SDR 113 million and SDR 72 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
A portion of the reserve tranche position is unremunerated. 
For a member that joined the IM F on or before April 1, 1978, 
the unremunerated portion is equ al to 25 percent of the 
member’s quota subscription on Ap ril 1, 1978 (that part of the 
quota subscription that was paid in gold prior to the Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement). For a 
member that joined the IMF after that date, its 
unremunerated reserve tranche is  a percentage of its initial 
quota equivalent to the ratio of total unremunerated reserve 
tranches for all other members to their total quota subscriptions when the new member joined the IMF. The 
average remunerated reserve tranche amounted to SDR 
103,298 million and SDR 93,949 million during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  
The rate of remuneration is currently equal to the SDR interest rate. Burden-sharing adjustments reduce the rate of remuneration, but under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the 
rate of remuneration may be no lower than 80 percent of the 
SDR interest rate. The average rate of remuneration (adjusted for burden-sharing) for the financial years ended 
April 30, 2022, and 2021, was 0.107 percent per annum and 
0.077 percent per annum, respectively. The amounts of 
burden-sharing adjustments for the same periods are 
disclosed in Note 17. 
19.  Administrative expenses 
Administrative expenses, most of which were incurred in US dollars, were as follows: 
 Reimbursements represent repayment for the expenses incurred in conducting the bus iness of the SDR Department 
and certain trusts and accounts administered by the IMF, and for the cost of the investment  operations of the SRP and the 
RSBIA (see Notes 1.4 and 21). 
20.  Special Disbursement Account  
Assets in the SDA can be used for special purposes authorized in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including providing financial assistance on special terms to low-income 
member countries under the St ructural Adjustment Facility 
and the Trust Fund.  
The SDA was initially activated to receive transfers from the 
Trust Fund. The IMF is the Trus tee of the Trust Fund, which 
was established in 1976 to provide balance of payments 
assistance on concessional terms to eligible members that 
qualified for such assistance. The Trust Fund was in 
liquidation following its termination in 1981. Since that date, the activities of the Trust Fund have been confined to the 
conclusion of its affairs.  
At April 30, 2021, the Trust F und had no assets other than 
loans and interest receivable from Sudan amounting to 
SDR 84 million. All interest income was deferred. There were no repayments to the Trust Fund during the financial year 
ended April 30, 2021. On June 29, 2021, Sudan repaid its 
total amount outstanding to the Trust Fund loans, this amount was received in the SDA and contributed to the PRG 
Trust, and the Trust Fund was liquidated. 
21.  Related party transactions 
The expenses of conducting the business of the SDR 
Department, the SRP, the SR BP, the RSBIA, and trusts 
administered by the IMF as Trus tee are paid by the GRA. At 
the end of each financial year, reimbursements are made by the SDR Department (through assessments levied on SDR 
Department participants) and ce rtain trusts and accounts in 
accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and 
decisions of the Executive Board. The SRP and the RSBIAadministered by the IMF as Trus tee are paid by the GRA. At 
the end of each financial year, reimbursements are made by the SDR Department (through assessments levied on SDR 
Department participants) and ce rtain trusts and accounts in 
accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and 
decisions of the Executive Board. The SRP and the RSBIA 
reimburse the GRA for the cost of the investment operations.  
The following summarizes the reimbursements to the GRA:

38 In April 2021, the Executive Board decided to forgo 
reimbursement by the PRG Trust for the year ended April 30, 
2021. Further in July 2021, the Executive Board decided to 
forgo reimbursement by the PRG Trust through the financial year ending April 30, 2026. Expenses of the PRG Trust for 
the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 were estimated at 
SDR 76 million and SDR 87 million, respectively.  
The General Department has transferred resources to the 
PRG Trust, the Trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations for the Heav ily Indebted Poor Countries 
and Interim ECF Subsidy Operations (the PRG-HIPC Trust), and the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCR Trust) to provide financial assistance to low-income 
countries. The following summarizes the cumulative inter-

Report of Independent Auditors  
 
To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund  
 
Opinion  
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) Department 
of the International Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial 
position as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of comprehensive income for the years 
then ended , including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “ financial statements”).  
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations for the years 
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board.  
 
Basis for Opinion  
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America (US G AAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to b e independent of the International 
Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant 
ethical requirements relating to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United 
States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements t hat are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to 
continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting 
period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alter native but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting 
process.  
 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
   
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolut e assurance and 
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for on e resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material 
if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggrega te, they would influence the judgment 
made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  
 
In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: 
 
● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such 
procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regard ing the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements.  
● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion o n the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is 
expressed.   
● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evalua te the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.  
● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, 
that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to continue as a going concern for a 
reason able period of time.  
 
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control -related 
matters that we identified d uring the audit. 
 
Supplemental Information  
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a 
whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 62 to 72 as of April 30, 2022 and 
for the yea rs ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are 
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The 
supplemental schedules are the responsibility of mana gement and were derived from and relate directly to 
the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information 
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and cer tain 
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statementsthemselves and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the 
information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are 
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

 1.  Nature of operations 
1.1  Role of the SDR 
The Special Drawing Right (SDR) is an international 
interest-bearing reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1969 to supplement existing reserve 
assets. SDRs are created through allocations by the IMF to 
participants in the SDR Department (see Note 1.7) and can be held and used by participants in the SDR Department, by 
the IMF through the General Re sources Account (GRA), and 
by certain official entities designated by the IMF and referred to as “prescribed holders”. The IMF has the authority to 
designate as “prescribed holders” of SDRs: (i) non-members; (ii) member countries t hat are not SDR Department 
participants; (iii) institutions that perform the functions of a 
central bank for more than one member; and (iv) other official entities. These prescribed holders may acquire and use 
SDRs in transactions by agreement (see Note 1.5.1) and in 
operations with participants and other holders. They may not, however, receive allocations of SDRs.  
The value of the SDR as a reserve asset derives from the 
commitments of participants to hold and accept SDRs and to 
honor various obligations connected with the proper 
functioning of the SDR Department. As such, the SDR is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF 
members; however, it is not a claim on the IMF. A freely 
usable currency is a member’s currency that the IMF has determined is widely used to make payments for international 
transactions and widely traded in the principal exchange 
markets. At present, the Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, and US dollar are classified as freely 
usable currencies. 
1.2  Purpose of the SDR Department 
The SDR Department was est ablished within the IMF to 
conduct all operations and transactions involving SDRs, 
following the creation of the S DR. IMF members may elect to 
participate in the SDR Department. At April 30, 2022, and 
2021, all members of the IMF were participants in the SDR 
Department, and 15 institutions were approved as prescribed 
holders. 
The IMF’s Articles of Agreement require that the resources of 
the SDR Department are held s eparately from the assets and 
liabilities of all the other accounts of, or administered by, the 
IMF. They may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, 
or losses of the IMF incurred in the operations of the General 
Department or other accounts, except that the SDR Department reimburses the General Department annually for 
expenses incurred in conducting the business of the SDR 
Department. 
1.3  SDR interest and charges 
Holders of SDRs (i.e., the IMF, participants, and prescribed 
holders) earn interest on their SDR holdings. Participants pay 
charges on their cumulative S DR allocations. Both interest 
and charges are set at the SDR interest rate (see Note 2.2). 
Participants that use their SD Rs will pay more charges than 
they will receive interest on their holdings, to the extent that 
they hold fewer SDRs than their cumulative allocations. 
Conversely, participants that  hold more SDRs than their 
cumulative allocations will receive more interest on their 
holdings than the charges they will pay on their allocations. 
Charges are also levied on any negative balance of a participant or unpaid charges. Total SDR interest on SDR 
holdings is equal to total charges on SDR allocations in the 
statement of comprehensive income as total SDR holdings are equal to total SDR allocations. 
1.4  Assessment 
The expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the IM F from the GRA, which isCharges are also levied on any negative balance of a participant or unpaid charges. Total SDR interest on SDR 
holdings is equal to total charges on SDR allocations in the 
statement of comprehensive income as total SDR holdings are equal to total SDR allocations. 
1.4  Assessment 
The expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the IM F from the GRA, which is 
reimbursed annually by the SDR Department. For this purpose, the SDR Department levies an assessment on all participants in proportion to their cumulative allocations at the 
end of each financial year. 
1.5  Uses of SDRs 
1.5.1  Transactions by agreement and prescribed operations The IMF’s Articles of Agreement authorize the exchange of 
SDRs for currency among participants, and the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) has the power to 
authorize other operations. 
Participants in the SDR Department may buy SDRs to 
discharge their obligations to the IMF or to replenish their 
SDR holdings. They may also sell SDRs in order to adjust the composition of their re serves (see Schedule 1). A 
participant may use SDRs freely to obtain an equivalent amount of currency in a transaction by agreement. Prescribed holders may enter into SDR sale or purchase 
transactions with participants or among themselves.  
Participants may conduct such transactions bilaterally with 
any participant or prescribed holder. However, in practice,II. SDR Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
56 such transactions are generally made through the voluntary 
trading market (see Note 1.6). 
The SDR is also used by several international and regional 
organizations as a unit of account or as the basis for their units of account. Several international conventions and 
treaties also use the SDR as a unit of account. An institution 
may use the SDR as its unit of account without being a participant in the SDR Department. 
1.5.2  GRA operations 
Participants can use SDRs in  operations and transactions 
involving the GRA, such as acquisitions of SDRs from the GRA, the payment of a portion of the participant’s quota, 
payment of charges, and repurchases. The GRA can use 
SDRs in operations and transactions involving participants, 
such as purchases, payment of  remuneration, payment of 
interest on GRA borrowings and repayment of GRA 
borrowings (see Schedule 1).  
1.5.3  Other IMF-related operations 
As a trustee for trusts set up for concessional lending and 
debt relief (Trusts), the IMF c onducts certain transactions in 
the SDR Department through a prescribed holder of SDRs. 
These transactions mainly include PRG Trust pass-through 
lending involving participants in the SDR Department. Other transactions in the Trusts include financial contributions 
provided by participants to the Trusts (see Schedule 1). 
1.6  Voluntary trading market 
The voluntary trading market in SDRs is coordinated by the 
IMF via voluntary trading arrangements (VTA) with a group of 
participants and one prescribed holder to buy and sell SDRs. 
The role of the IMF in these transactions is to act as an intermediary, matching participants in this managed market 
in a manner that meets, to the greatest extent possible, the 
requirements and preferences of buyers and sellers of SDRs.  
The VTA allow the IMF to fac ilitate purchases and sales of 
SDRs on behalf of any participant or prescribed holder in the SDR Department against freely usable currencies, subject to 
the constraint that all transacti ons take place at the official 
SDR exchange rate for t he currency involved.  
To date, the voluntary trading market has proved sufficiently 
liquid to absorb demand for sales and acquisitions of SDRs. However, in the event that there are not enough voluntary buyers, the IMF’s Articles of Agreement provide for a 
designation mechanism to guar antee the liquidity of the 
SDR. The designation mechanism, which was last activated 
in 1987, provides a backstop  to exchange SDRs for 
currency, for members with balance of payments needs.   
 
 1.7  Allocations and cancellations of SDRs 
1.7.1  General allocations 
The IMF’s Board of Governors,  on the basis of proposals of 
the Managing Director and ag reement by the Executive 
Board, has the authority to provide unconditional liquidity through general allocations of SDRs to participants in the 
SDR Department. In all of its decisions on general allocations 
of SDRs, the IMF, as prescribed under its Articles of 
Agreement, must seek to meet the long-term global need to supplement existing reserve assets in such manner as will 
promote the attainment of the IMF’s purposes and avoid 
economic stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand 
and inflation. A general SDR allocation also requires the 
support of an 85 percent majority of the total voting power.  
Since the creation of the SDR in  1969, there have been four 
general allocations. The first allocation was distributed in 
1970–72 (SDR 9.3 billion), the second in 1979–81 (SDR 12.1 
billion), the third in 2009 (SDR 161.2 billion), and the fourth, 
the largest so far, was approved by the Board of Governors 
of the IMF on August 2, 2021  (SDR 456.5 billion). The fourth 
general allocation was made on August 23, 2021, to IMF members that are participant s in the SDR Department, in 
proportion to their paid IMF quotas as of the date of adoptionbillion), the third in 2009 (SDR 161.2 billion), and the fourth, 
the largest so far, was approved by the Board of Governors 
of the IMF on August 2, 2021  (SDR 456.5 billion). The fourth 
general allocation was made on August 23, 2021, to IMF members that are participant s in the SDR Department, in 
proportion to their paid IMF quotas as of the date of adoption 
of the Board of Governors’ resolution.  
Decisions to allocate SDRs are typically made at the start of “basic periods,” which run consecutively and are normally for five years. Under the IMF’s Ar ticles of Agreement, the IMF 
has the flexibility to decide whether the basic period should be less than five years. The current basic period (the twelfth basic period) is January 1, 2022–December 31, 2026.  
1.7.2  Special allocation under the Fourth Amendment 
The Fourth Amendment to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement 
became effective on August 10, 2009, and provided for a 
special one-time allocation of SDR 21.5 billion.
 The purpose 
of the special allocation was to enable all members of the 
SDR Department to participate in the SDR system and to 
correct for the fact that count ries that joined the IMF after 
1981 (more than one-fifth of the IMF membership, and 
notably many of the economies in transition), had not 
received an SDR allocation at the time.  
SDRs allocated under a special allocation to participants with 
overdue obligations to the IMF (i.e., the GRA, the 
SDR Department, and overdue liabilities to the IMF as 
trustee), are held in an escrow account within the SDR 
Department and are released to such participants upon settlement of all overdue obligations to the IMF (see Note 4).II. SDR Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 57 1.7.3  Cancellation of SDRs 
The IMF has the authority to cancel, in part or in whole, 
SDRs created under previous allocations. To date there have 
been no cancellations. 
2.  Basis of preparation and measurement 
The financial statements of  the SDR Department are 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention. The financial statements have also been prepared on the basis that the SDR Department will continue 
to operate as a going concern. 
The SDR Department is self -financed and does not have any 
equity as net cumulative allocations are equal to SDR 
holdings. It holds no cash or cash equivalents and, as net 
operational income and net expenditure are always equal, it generates no income. Cash flows arising from operating 
activities are limited to the receipt of charges and 
assessments and payment of interest and administrative 
expenses. A statement of cash flows is not presented as it 
would not provide additional information beyond that already 
contained in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
Changes in SDR holdings are shown in Schedule 1. 
2.1  Unit of account 
The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the 
IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined 
daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket 
currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market 
exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition 
of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These 
reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR 
valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of 
currencies), determine the relative weights of those 
currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are 
used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the 
currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30, 
2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  
SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount 
Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174 
Euro 30.93 0.38671 
Japanese yen 8.33 11.900 
Pound sterling 8.09   0.085946 
US dollar  41.73 0.58252 
 At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$ 1.34430 
(US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive 
Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  
On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the 
quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR 
and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR 
currency and interest rate baskets and approved their 
updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher 
weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, 
the euro, and the Japanese yen.  
Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket 
will be assigned the following weights:  
SDR basket currency Weight (in percent) 
Chinese renminbi 12.28 
Euro 29.31 
Japanese yen 7.59 
Pound sterling 7.44 
US dollar  43.38 
 
The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated 
on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the 
interim justify an earlier review.  
2.2  SDR interest rate 
The SDR interest rate is used to calculate the interest paid 
on holdings and charges received on allocations. 
The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a 
weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments 
in the money markets of the SDR basket currencies as follows: 
SDR basket currency Yield or rateinterim justify an earlier review.  
2.2  SDR interest rate 
The SDR interest rate is used to calculate the interest paid 
on holdings and charges received on allocations. 
The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a 
weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments 
in the money markets of the SDR basket currencies as follows: 
SDR basket currency Yield or rate 
Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China 
Treasury bonds as published by the China 
Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. 
Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central 
government bonds with a minimum rating of 
AA published by the European Central Bank 
Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills 
Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills 
US dollar Three-month Treasury bills 
 The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent 
and is rounded to three decimal places. The average interest 
rate was 0.107 percent and 0.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.II. SDR Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
58 2.3  Use of estimates and judgement 
The preparation of financ ial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates, and 
assumptions that affect the application of the accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future pe riods affected.  
The most significant estimates and judgements used in applying accounting policies include assessing potential impairment of the participant s’ net obligations to the 
SDR Department (see Note 3). 
 
3.  Summary of significant accounting policies 
3.1  Financial instruments 
Classification and measurement 
Financial instruments are recognized when the SDR 
Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. At initial recogn ition, a financial instrument is 
measured at its fair value, wh ich is best evidenced by the 
transaction amount. Subsequently, financial instruments are 
measured at amortized cost.  
Impairment  
An allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) must be 
recognized for either 12-mont h or lifetime expected credit 
losses, depending on whether there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk since inception. In making such a 
determination, all relevant information, including forward-
looking information that is avai lable without undue cost or 
effort, should be considered.  
 
At each reporting date, the SDR Department assesses on a 
forward-looking basis the ECL associated with its financial 
assets at amortized cost. The measurement of ECL reflects: 
(i) an unbiased and probabilit y-weighted amount that is 
determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; (ii) 
the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and supportable 
information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and 
forecasts of future economic conditions. 
If the SDR Department needed to  recognize ECL, they would 
be recorded as impairment allowances. 3.2  SDR allocations and holdings 
An SDR allocation by the IMF to a participant results in an 
increase, by the same amount, of the participant’s SDR 
holdings and allocations. Conversely, a cancellation of a 
participant’s SDRs results in a decrease, by the same amount, of the participant’s SDR holdings and allocations. 
Neither allocation nor cancellation changes the member’s net 
position in the SDR Department.  
Participants with holdings below their allocations have a net 
obligation to the SDR Department, which is presented as an asset in the statements of fina ncial position. Participants with 
holdings above their allocations have established a net claim on the SDR Department, which is presented in the statements of financial position as a liability. 
Impairment of participants’ net obligations to the SDR 
Department 
The likelihood of the SDR Depar tment incurring credit losses 
is remote considering the IMF’s unique relationship with its member countries, and its multilayered risk management 
framework. In addition, the IM F enjoys a de facto preferred 
creditor status, which has been recognized by the official 
community and generally accepted by private creditors. The 
debtor positions in the SDR Department do not have maturity 
dates and could be held until the participant’s withdrawal 
from the SDR Department or the liquidation of the 
SDR Department. Overdue charges, if any, would accrue 
interest at the SDR interest rate in perpetuity preserving the time value of money. The SDR Department has not 
recognized any impairment losses since inception. 
3.3  Interest and chargesdates and could be held until the participant’s withdrawal 
from the SDR Department or the liquidation of the 
SDR Department. Overdue charges, if any, would accrue 
interest at the SDR interest rate in perpetuity preserving the time value of money. The SDR Department has not 
recognized any impairment losses since inception. 
3.3  Interest and charges  
Interest is accrued on holdings of SDRs, and charges are levied on each participant’s cumulative SDR allocations at 
the SDR interest rate, with t he net result to be paid or 
received by the SDR Department  each quarter. If sufficient 
SDRs are not received from the participant because charges are overdue, additional SDRs are temporarily created to cover the obligation. This is a receivable that is reversed 
when the participant settles the overdue charges. Interest 
and charges are settled by crediting and debiting the individual holdings accounts prom ptly at the beginning of the 
following quarter. 
3.4  Assessment 
Expenses of conducting the bus iness of the SDR Department 
are recognized in the statements of comprehensive income on an accrual basis. The corresponding SDR assessment on allocations is recognized as income.II. SDR Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 59 3.5  New and revised International Financial Reporting 
Standards and Interpretations 
3.5.1  New standards and ame ndments to existing standards 
effective in future years 
Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial 
Statements”, and IFRS Practice Statement 2, “Making Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to 
help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting 
policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The 
amendments will be adopted by t he SDR Department for the 
financial year ending April 30, 2024, and are not expected to 
have a material effect on the SDR Department’s financial 
statements. 
Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February 
2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The 
amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or 
after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by the SDR Department for the financial year ending April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the 
SDR Department’s financial statements.  
4.  Allocations and holdings 
At April 30, 2022, and 2021, cumulative allocations to 
participants totaled SDR 660.7 billion and SDR 204.2 billion, respectively.

In accordance with the provisions of the Fourth Amendment 
of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, SDRs allocated under the special allocation are held in escrow on behalf of participants 
that had overdue obligations to  the General Department or 
the PRG Trust at the time of the allocation. On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all its over due obligations to the IMF, 
totaling SDR 964  million. As a result, SDR 16.1 million 
previously held in escrow for Sudan was released to its SDR holdings account and its allocations were adjusted 
accordingly. The balance held in escrow amounted to zero and SDR 16.1 million at April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021, 
respectively.  
 
5.  Related party transactions and 
administrative expenses 
The GRA is a holder of SDRs and conducts operations and 
transactions with SDR Department participants. The GRA’s holdings of SDRs amounted to SDR 22.3 billion and 
SDR 22.2 billion at April 30, 2 022, and 2021, respectively.  
The expenses of conducting the business of the SDR 
Department, paid by the IMF from the GRA, and reimbursed 
annually by the SDR Department, were SDR 8.4 million and SDR 3.0 million for each of the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.Supplemental SchedulesII. SDR Department SCHEDULE 1: Statements of Changes in SDR Holdings for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022,

Report of Independent Auditors  
 
To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund  
 
Opinions  
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG 
Trust), the Trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations for the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries and Interim ECF Subsidy Operations and related Umbrella Account for HIPC Operations (the 
PRG -HIPC Trust and related Umbrella Account), and the Catastrophe Containment a nd Relief Trust and 
the related Umbrella Account for CCR Operations (CCR Trust and related Umbrella Account) (hereafter 
collectively referred to as the “Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts” or the “Trusts”), which 
comprise the statements of financi al position as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of 
comprehensive income and changes in resources and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the 
related notes (collectively referred to as the “ financial statements”).  
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of each of the Trusts as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of each of their operations and 
each of their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.  
 
Basis for Opinions  
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described i n the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Trusts and the 
International Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with  the 
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the 
United States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants. We believe tha t the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.  
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and  fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Trusts’ ability to 
continue as a going c oncern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting 
period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Trust s or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Trusts’ financial reporting process.  
 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
   
Our obje ctives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high level  of assurance but is not absolute assurance and 
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentatio ns, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material 
if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment 
made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  
 
In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: 
 
● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such 
procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements.  
● Obtain an understanding of internal control r elevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts’ internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is 
expressed.   
● Evaluate  the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.  
● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are condition s or events, considered in the aggregate, 
that raise substantial doubt about the Trusts’ ability to continue as a going concern for a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matte rs, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control -related 
matters that we identified during the audit.Supplemental Information  
 
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the  financial statements of each Trust 
taken as a whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 100 to 108 as of and for 
the year ended April 30, 2022 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are presented for 
purposes of  additional analysis and are not a required part of the respective Trust’s financial statements.  
The supplemental schedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate 
directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the respective Trust’s financial 
statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied  in the audits of the 
respective Trust’s financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
respective Trust’s financial s tatements or to the respective Trust’s financial statements themselves and 
other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the information to the 
applicable procedures required by ISAs.  In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are fairly stated, in all 
material respects, in relation to the respective Trust’s financial statements taken as a whole.

April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 1.  Nature of operations 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is the Trustee of the 
following trusts: 
i. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG 
Trust)  
ii. The Trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Operations for the Heavily  Indebted Poor Countries 
and Interim ECF Subsidy Operations (the 
PRG-HIPC Trust) and the related Umbrella Account 
for HIPC Operations (the PRG-HIPC Umbrella 
Account) 
iii. The Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCR Trust) and the related Umbrella Account for CCR Operations (the CCR Umbrella Account). 
Collectively, these trusts are referred to as the “Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts” or the “Trusts”. The Trusts provide loans on concessional terms and/or debt relief 
assistance to qualifying low-income member countries.  
The assets and liabilities of each Trust are held separately 
from those of all other administered or proprietary accounts 
of the IMF, including those of other Trusts. Each Trust’s 
assets cannot be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or 
losses incurred in the administration of other accounts. Administrative expenses incurred by each Trust are paid by the IMF and reimbursed by each Trust in accordance with the 
IMF’s Articles of Agreement and relevant decisions of the 
IMF Executive Board (Executive Board). Resources not immediately needed in operations are invested as allowed by 
the individual instruments est ablishing each of the Trusts 
(Trust Instruments).  
1.1  PRG Trust 
The PRG Trust provides loans on concessional terms to low-income member countries assessed as eligible to qualify for 
PRG Trust financing by the Executive Board.  
Upon the request of a qualifying member country, PRG Trust 
resources may be made available either under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright disbursements (i.e., 
loans disbursed without an arrangement). An arrangement is 
a decision of the IMF, as Trus tee, that gives a member the 
assurance that the Trust stands ready to provide resources 
during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in 
accordance with the terms of the arrangement.  Financing in the PRG Trust is available under the following 
facilities:  
i. The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for members 
with protracted balance of payments problems 
under three- to five-year arrangements 
ii. The Standby Credit Facility (SCF) for actual or 
potential short-term balance of payments needs 
under one- to three-year arrangements 
iii. The Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for urgent balance 
of payments needs, which provides financial support 
in an outright loan disbursement. 
Until April 10, 2010, the PRG Trust also provided loans under the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) to facilitate member 
countries’ adjustment to sudd en and exogenous shocks. The 
last ESF loans were fully repaid during the financial year 
ended April 30, 2021.The operations of the PRG Trust are 
conducted through the following accounts:  
Loan Accounts   
All concessional lending to low-income member countries 
under the PRG Trust facilitie s is conducted in the Loan 
Accounts, which serve as pass-through for receipt and 
provision of principal for concessional lending (i.e., the PRG 
Trust may borrow from lenders and onlend to the low-income 
member countries). The four Loan Accounts comprise three 
earmarked accounts that service ECF, SCF, and RCF loans specifically, and a general account  that services loans for all 
PRG Trust facilities.  
The Loan Accounts receive interest from loans (at 
concessional interest rates) and may pay interest on 
borrowings (at interest rates higher than the concessional 
interest rates), with the difference being covered by transfers from the Subsidy Accounts. 
Subsidy AccountsPRG Trust facilities.  
The Loan Accounts receive interest from loans (at 
concessional interest rates) and may pay interest on 
borrowings (at interest rates higher than the concessional 
interest rates), with the difference being covered by transfers from the Subsidy Accounts. 
Subsidy Accounts   
The Subsidy Accounts include the General, ECF, SCF, RCF 
Subsidy Accounts (the General and Earmarked Subsidy 
Accounts) and the Subsidy Reserve Account, which was 
established on July 14, 2021.  
The General and Earmarked Subsidy Accounts hold 
resources to finance the cost of providing subsidized loans to low-income member countries; that is, the available 
resources in these accounts are drawn by the Trustee to pay 
the difference between the interest due on PRG Trust loans and the interest due on borrowings in the Loan Accounts. 
The Subsidy Reserve Account is designed to subsidize PRGIII. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
80 Trust lending after the resources in the General and 
Earmarked Subsidy Accounts are exhausted and to provide 
additional security to the lenders of the Loan Accounts in the 
event of delayed payment or nonpayment by PRG Trust borrowers and the depletion of the Reserve Account (see 
below).  
The resources of the Subsid y Accounts consist of grant 
contributions, transfers by the IMF from the Special 
Disbursement Account (SDA), and net earnings from investments. The General Subsidy Account and Subsidy 
Reserve Account may also receive transfers from the Deposit 
and Investment Account (see below). The Subsidy Accounts can also borrow from donors and invest the proceeds to 
generate income for subsidization.   
Reserve Account  
The Reserve Account holds resources to: 
i. Provide security to the lenders of the Loan Accounts 
in the event of delayed or nonpayment by PRG Trust borrowers. 
ii. Meet temporary mismat ches between repayments 
from borrowers and payments to lenders. 
iii. Reimburse the IMF for administering PRG Trust operations. 
iv. Generate investment income that can be used to 
fund the PRG Trust when resources in the Subsidy 
Accounts have been depleted. 
The resources of the Reserve Account consist of transfers 
from the SDA and net earnings from investments.  
Deposit and Investment Account  
The Deposit and Investment Account was established on 
July 14, 2021, to provide a separate vehicle for the PRG 
Trust to borrow resources to generate net investment 
earnings for the benefit of t he Subsidy Reserve Account or, 
at the request of donors, the General Subsidy Account. The 
resources held in the Deposit and Investment Account 
consist of the proceeds from  deposit and other investment 
agreements with contributors and the net investment 
earnings on the investment of these resources. 
1.2  PRG-HIPC Trust and the PRG-HIPC Umbrella 
Account 
The PRG-HIPC Trust provides assistance to eligible low-
income member countries to reduce their external debt 
burden to sustainable levels. Assistance from the PRG-HIPC 
Trust may be provided in the form of grants or loans. 
The operations of the PRG- HIPC Trust are conducted 
through subaccounts within t he PRG-HIPC Trust Account 
and the related Umbrella Account. The PRG-HIPC Trust 
Account receives and invests resources, which consist of grant contributions, transfers from the SDA, and net earnings 
from investments. The PRG-HIPC Trust can also borrow 
from donors and invest the proceeds to generate income for 
its operations. Once the Execut ive Board approves a grant 
for debt service relief to an eligible low-income member 
country, the respective resources are transferred to the PRG-
HIPC Umbrella Account, where they are administered on 
behalf of that member count ry until conditions for the 
disbursements of debt service re lief on behalf of the member 
country are satisfied. 
1.3  CCR Trust and the CCR Umbrella Account 
The CCR Trust provides balance of payments assistance in 
the form of grants to eligible low-income member countries following qualifying catastrophic natural or public health 
disasters.  
The operations of the CCR Trust are conducted through 
three Trust Accounts and the related Umbrella Account. The 
CCR Trust Accounts comprise two earmarked accounts for 
Catastrophe Containment and Post-Catastrophe assistance 
and the General Account, containing nonearmarked funds available for both types of assistance. These accounts receive and invest resources, which consist of grant 
contributions, transfers from the SDA, and net earnings from 
investments. The CCR Trust can also borrow from donors and invest the proceeds to generate income for its 
operations. Once the Executive Board approves a grant for 
debt service relief to an eligible low-income member country,contributions, transfers from the SDA, and net earnings from 
investments. The CCR Trust can also borrow from donors and invest the proceeds to generate income for its 
operations. Once the Executive Board approves a grant for 
debt service relief to an eligible low-income member country, 
the respective resources are transferred to the CCR 
Umbrella Account, where they are administered on behalf of 
that member country until condit ions for the disbursements of 
debt service relief are satisfied. 
1.4  Impact of geopolitical and global economic 
developments 
The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in 
global economic activity. The IMF, as Trustee of the Trusts, 
responded to the crisis with unprecedented speed and magnitude of financial assistance to help low-income 
member countries. During the financial year ended April 30, 
2021, the PRG Trust disbursed a significant number of loans to eligible member countries under the RCF (see Note 6.2). 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Executive Board 
approved a decision on March 26, 2020, to adapt the 
eligibility criteria for receiving assistance in the CCR Trust for 
a qualifying public health disaster. Subsequently, the Executive Board determined that  the COVID-19 pandemic is 
a qualifying public health disaster, effective April 14, 2020, and approved a significant amount  of grants for debt relief 
assistance in the CCR Trust (see Note 9.1).III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 81 As a result of the Trusts pr oviding an elevated level of 
financial assistance, the PRG Trust’s credit exposure has 
increased compared with the pre-pandemic level (see Note 
4.2.1.2), as did the liquidi ty needs in the PRG and CCR 
Trusts (see Note 4.2.3.1). 
The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant 
uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth 
and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further 
demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. 
The war in Ukraine that start ed in February 2022 is expected 
to have a significant negative effect on global growth through 
commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war 
could trigger additional demand for financial assistance.  
The PRG Trust continues to manage its credit risks in 
accordance with its existing risk management framework 
(see Note 4.1) and fundraising efforts are on-going to ensure 
the Trusts are adequately fina nced (see Note 4.2.3.1).  
The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have 
effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the 
global developments on the in vestment portfolios of the 
Trusts. Financial instruments held at fair value recognized through profit or loss had fully and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the onset of the pandemic. However, 
in light of the war in Ukra ine, and tightening monetary 
conditions, coupled with a sharp increase in inflation and 
inflation expectations, the investment portfolios remain 
subject to challenging market conditions and high volatility. 
The effects of global developments on PRG and PRG-HIPC Trust investment portfolios are also reflected in the value at 
risk (VaR) (see Note 4.3.2.1). The valuation of the Trusts’ 
investments held at amorti zed cost was not impacted. 
As of the date of these fina ncial statements there had been 
no negative impact of global developments on the 
operational results of the Trusts, including from any 
impairment analysis of the PRG Trust’s loan portfolio (see 
Note 6.3). See also Note 2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of Trusts’ 
financial statements. 
2.  Basis of preparation and measurement 
The financial statements of the Trusts are prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). The financial st atements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial instrument s at fair value through profit 
or loss. The financial statements have also been prepared on the basis that the Trusts will continue to operate as going 
concerns. 
2.1   Unit of account 
The financial statements are pr esented in SDRs, which the 
Trusts use as the unit of a ccount. The value of the SDR is 
determined daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of 
the basket currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of 
market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the 
composition of the SDR valuation basket at five-year 
intervals. These reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the 
selection of currencies), deter mine the relative weights of 
those currencies, and assess t he financial instruments that 
are used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts 
of the currencies in the ba sket, at April 30, 2022, and 
April 30, 2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows: 
SDR basket currency  Weight (in percent) Amount

1.43599 at April 30, 2021). 
The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled 
to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive 
Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  
On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the 
quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR 
and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR 
currency and interest rate baskets and approved their 
updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher 
weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, 
the euro, and the Japanese yen.  
Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket 
will be assigned the following weights:  
SDR basket currency Weight (in percent) 
Chinese renminbi 12.28 
Euro  29.31 
Japanese yen    7.59 
Pound sterling    7.44 
US dollar    43.38 
The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated 
on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the 
new weights. The next review of the method of valuation ofIII. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
82 the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the 
interim justify an earlier review.  
2.2  SDR interest rate 
The SDR interest rate is used to calculate interest on certain cash balances and borrowings. The SDR interest rate also provides the basis for setting the interest levied on PRG 
Trust outstanding loans (see Note 6.4) and interest 
calculated on most borrowings in the PRG Trust’s Loan 
Accounts.  
The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a 
weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments 
in the money markets of the members whose currencies are included in the SDR valuation basket: 
SDR basket currency Yield or rate 
Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China 
Treasury bonds as published by the China 
Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. 
Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central 
government bonds with a minimum rating of 
AA published by the European Central Bank 
Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills 
Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills 
US dollar Three-month Treasury bills 
 The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent 
and is rounded to three decimal places.  
The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum 
and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years 
ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
2.3  Use of estimates and judgement 
The preparation of financ ial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised 
and in any future periods affected.  
The most significant estimates and judgements used in 
applying accounting policies include expected credit losses 
measurement for PRG Trust outstanding loans (see Notes 
3.1, 3.2.3, and 6.3), the application of the practical expedient 
under the interest rate benchmark reform (see Note 4.2.2.1), 
and fair value measurement of  financial instruments (see 
Notes 3.3 and 10). 3.  Summary of significant accounting policies 
3.1  Financial instruments  
Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Note 3.2. 
Measurement at initial recognition 
Financial instruments are recognized when the Trusts 
become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Trusts use settlement date accounting for all 
financial instruments except for investments, which are 
accounted for using trade date accounting (see Note 3.2.2). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at its 
fair value, which is best evidenced by the transaction 
amount.  
Derecognition  
Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when 
the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the 
assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and 
either: (i) the Trusts transfe r substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership; or (ii) the Trusts neither transfer nor retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but 
the Trusts have not retained control.  
Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are 
extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged, 
canceled, or expires).  
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial 
assets 
A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial 
asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics. 
Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual 
cash flows where those cash flows represent solelycanceled, or expires).  
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial 
assets 
A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial 
asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics. 
Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual 
cash flows where those cash flows represent solely 
payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized 
cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is 
included in the statements of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.  Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition is recogniz ed in the statements of 
comprehensive income.  
Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual 
cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows 
represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Trusts did not have financial assets at FVOCI 
during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be 
measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 83 Impairment  
At each reporting date, the Trusts assess on a 
forward-looking basis the ex pected credit losses (ECL) 
associated with their financial assets at AC and with the 
undrawn balances under their lending commitments. The 
measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and 
probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating 
a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is 
available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date 
about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future 
economic conditions.  
If the Trusts needed to recognize ECL, they would be 
recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as 
a liability provision for undrawn commitments.  
Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest 
income would be calculated for it by applying the effective 
interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment 
allowance). 
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial 
liabilities 
Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. 
All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. 
Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in 
the statements of comprehensiv e income using the effective 
interest method. 
3.2  Financial assets and liabilities  
3.2.1  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are financial assets measured at 
AC. They comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and 
other highly liquid short-term investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are held for the pur pose of meeting short-term 
cash commitments rather than  for investment or other 
purposes.  
3.2.2  Investments 
Investments are financial assets that include short-term 
investments, fixed-term and demand deposits, fixed-income securities, equity securities, a nd derivative assets. Derivative 
liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in the statements of financial positi on. Among the Trusts, only the 
PRG Trust invests in equity securities and derivatives. 
The Trusts’ investment portfolios are managed under defined 
investment strategies (see Note 5), and their performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis. The business model for the 
invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities are classified at FVPL. A portion of the funds may be held in fixed-term and demand 
deposits, pending investment in  assets consistent with each 
Trust’s investment strategy or  as an investment decision to 
achieve specific objectives. These investments are measured 
at AC.  
Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the 
trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable 
or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, pending settlement of a transaction. 
Investment income compri ses interest income on 
investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL 
investments, including currency valuation differences arising 
from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all trading-related investment fees. 
Interest income from investments is recognized using the 
effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized based on the ex-dividend date. 
3.2.3  Loans receivable  
Loans receivable are financial assets that are measured at 
AC. They represent financing provided to low-income 
member countries under the various PRG Trust financing facilities (see Note 1.1).  
Interest income on loans receivable is recognized using the 
effective interest method.  
Impairment of PRG Trust loans3.2.3  Loans receivable  
Loans receivable are financial assets that are measured at 
AC. They represent financing provided to low-income 
member countries under the various PRG Trust financing facilities (see Note 1.1).  
Interest income on loans receivable is recognized using the 
effective interest method.  
Impairment of PRG Trust loans 
The PRG Trust’s assessment of its loans receivable for 
impairment is grounded in the c ontext of the nature of the 
PRG Trust’s lending and the unique institutional st atus of the 
IMF, as Trustee:  
 The IMF, as Trustee, has a unique relationship with its 
member countries, all of which are shareholders in the 
institution. 
 PRG Trust lending under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic 
policies that the member commits to in order to overcome 
balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the PRG Trust. 
 The IMF, as Trustee, employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1.1). 
 The IMF, as Trustee, also has  de facto preferred creditor 
status, which has been recognized by the official creditor community and generally accepted by private creditors.  
Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the 
likelihood of the PRG Trust incurring credit losses.III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
84 The PRG Trust has not recognized any impairment losses 
since inception. Also, unlike lar ge financial institutions in the 
private sector, the PRG Trust’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to low-income member countries, with each member’s  circumstances varying. 
Therefore, a statistical approach to credit risk assessment, such as probability of default  (PD) and loss given default 
(LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector, is neither feasible nor appropriate for the PRG Trust.  
Similarly, the assessment of the PRG Trust’s credit risk 
cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its unique 
characteristics, the PRG Trust’s credit risk exposure is not comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial 
financial entities, and as a cooperative member organization, 
the IMF, as Trustee, does not pr oduce its own internal credit 
rating grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the PRG Trust is 
assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative 
considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as 
the status of the economic programs underlying PRG Trust 
lending, if any; the member ’s cooperation on policy 
implementation and timely settlement of PRG Trust financial 
obligations; and forward-looking assessments of the 
member’s capacity to repay. 
The PRG Trust has developed a model for ECL estimation 
based on changes in credit qua lity since initial recognition, 
where credit quality is classi fied as Stage 1, Stage 2, or 
Stage 3. Loans for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that are 
credit-impaired (Stage 3), have their ECL measured on a lifetime basis. Loans for wh ich there was no significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition (Stage 1) have their ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL that result 
from default events possible within the next 12 months. 
The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the PRG 
Trust in the measurement of ECL are discussed below: 
(i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired  
The PRG Trust considers a member country to be in default 
when it is six months or more overdue in settling its financial 
obligations to the PRG Trust. This rebuts the presumption 
that default occurs no later than 90 days past due, reflecting the nature of the PRG Trust’s financing and the unique 
institutional status of the IM F, as Trustee, as well as 
consistency with the threshold for internal risk management 
purposes. A loan is considered credit-impaired when the 
obligation has defaulted. 
(ii) Significant increase in credit risk  
The PRG Trust assesses whether a significant increase in 
credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date with the 
risk of default at the date of the most recent disbursement to the debtor member. The asse ssment is performed at each 
reporting date and takes into account a range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including overdue obligations to the 
PRG Trust, signals of noncooperation by the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the PRG 
Trust. The criteria used to identify significant increases in 
credit risk are monitored and reviewed for appropriateness at 
least annually.  
The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may, 
on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the 
presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when 
contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due. 
During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, 
the PRG Trust did not have any member country more than 
30 days past due. 
(iii) Low credit risk  
The PRG Trust assumes that the credit risk of a memberon the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the 
presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when 
contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due. 
During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, 
the PRG Trust did not have any member country more than 
30 days past due. 
(iii) Low credit risk  
The PRG Trust assumes that the credit risk of a member 
country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is considered to have low credit 
risk at the reporting date,  as defined below.  
Credit risk related to the PRG Trust’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; 
(ii) the member country has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and 
(iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in 
the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow 
obligations.  
(iv) Measuring ECL 
ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with 
contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash 
shortfalls at the effective intere st rate, which is the interest 
rate for PRG Trust loans set by the IMF, as Trustee. ECL are 
estimated by assessing a range of possible outcomes in light of expected future economic conditions, weighted according 
to the assessed probability of each outcome. This entails 
considerable judgement and uncert ainty about the estimates.  
For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are inte gral to the PRG Trust’s financial structure and 
operations are also considered, such as additional interest on 
overdue obligations. 
Write-off 
In the unlikely event that a member with outstanding loans to 
the PRG Trust (i) withdraws from the IMF; (ii) repudiates its outstanding obligations to the PRG Trust, and (iii) there are 
no prospects of recovering amounts due to the PRG Trust in the foreseeable future, the PRG Trust would recognize the ultimate loss, and the withdrawn member’s outstanding loan 
to the PRG Trust would be written off.III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 85 3.2.4  Borrowings 
Borrowings are financial liabilities measured at AC and 
represent financing received from lenders (see Note 7). 
Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the effective interest method.  
For borrowings that transition from a London Interbank 
Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based interest rate, the Trusts apply 
the IASB’s Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform Phase 2 
amendments, which were adopted early as disclosed in the financial statements for the year  ended April 30, 2021. The 
amendments include a practical expedient that allows for changes to the basis for determining contractual cash flows to be treated as changes to a floating rate of interest, 
provided certain conditions are met. The conditions include 
the change being necessary as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and the transition taking place on an 
economically equivalent basis.  
3.3  Fair value measurement 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value 
measurement is based on th e presumption that the 
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, 
in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market. 
A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair 
value under which financial instruments are categorized 
based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity 
can access at the measurement date; 
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); 
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset 
or liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level 
within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is 
based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair 
value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a 
Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are 
both observable and unobservable.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are 
described in Note 10.
 
3.4  Foreign currency translation 
Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the 
transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other 
currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the 
date of the financial statements. Exchange differences 
arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different from those at the originatin g date of the transaction are 
included in the determination of total comprehensive income.  
3.5  Contributions 
The Trusts accept contributions on such terms and conditions as agreed between the Trusts and the contributor. 
Contributions are recognized as income after the 
achievement of specified conditions and are subject to the bilateral agreements stipulating how the resources are to be 
used. 
3.6  Debt relief assistance 
The PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts provide debt relief assistance to eligible members, which is used by the 
members to pay their eligible debt service payments to the IMF’s General Resources Account (GRA) or PRG Trust. The 
debt relief assistance is recognized as an expense after the 
terms and conditions set out in the respective Trust Instruments are satisfied, incl uding eligible members meeting 
the debt relief qualif ication criteria.members to pay their eligible debt service payments to the IMF’s General Resources Account (GRA) or PRG Trust. The 
debt relief assistance is recognized as an expense after the 
terms and conditions set out in the respective Trust Instruments are satisfied, incl uding eligible members meeting 
the debt relief qualif ication criteria. 
3.7  Amendments to existing standards effective in 
future years 
Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, were issued 
in May 2020 to clarify certain aspects of derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendm ents are effective for annual 
periods starting on or after January 1, 2022. The amendments will be adopted by t he Trusts for the financial 
year ending April 30, 2023, and are not expected to have a 
material effect on the Trus ts’ financial statements. 
Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial 
Statements” and IFRS Prac tice Statement 2, “Making 
Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting 
policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual 
periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by t he Trusts for the financial 
year ending April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a 
material effect on the Trus ts’ financial statements. 
Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February 
2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. TheIII. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
86 amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or 
after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by 
the Trusts for the financial year ending April 30, 2024, and 
are not expected to have a material effect on the Trusts’ financial statements. 
4.  Financial risk management 
4.1  Risk management framework 
By virtue of their role established through the Trust 
Instruments, the Trusts face a range of financial and 
nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and 
assessment across the Trusts’ activities. The IMF, as 
Trustee, has adopted the thre e lines of defense model for 
risk management.  
 Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by 
establishing and main taining a system of internal controls. 
 A risk management function is responsible for developing 
and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and 
reporting on the Trusts’ overa ll risk profile, highlighting 
areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.  
 An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of 
governance and internal control processes.  
 Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the 
cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis 
risk acceptance.  
4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than 
investments 
Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are 
exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  
4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than 
investments Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses should any of the Trusts’ borrowers fail to fulfill their financial obligations 
to the Trusts. Currently, only the PRG Trust is exposed to 
credit risk that arises on loans receivable and undrawn committed amounts under approved financing commitments.  
4.2.1.1  Credit risk management practices Credit risk is inherent in the PRG Trust’s unique role in the 
international monetary system because the PRG Trust has 
limited ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides financing when other sources of credit are not 
available to a country. In addition, the PRG Trust’s credit concentration is generally hi gh due to the nature of the financial assistance provided to low-income member countries. 
Measures to help mitigate the PRG Trust’s credit risk include 
program design and conditionality, which serve to help member countries solve their balance of payments problems 
within the period of a PRG Trust-supported program and to provide the needed assurances that the member will be able 
to repay the PRG Trust. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, regular reviews by the IMF, post-financing assessments, preventive and remedial measures for dealing 
with overdue financial obligations, and financial safeguards 
such as special interest on overdue obligations.  
The PRG Trust has established limits on overall access to its 
resources. The Executive Boar d approved increases to the 
overall annual and cumulative access limits across all PRG 
Trust facilities on July 14, 2021. The annual access 
increased from 100 percent of a low-income member 
country’s IMF quota (quota) to 145 percent, and the cumulative access limit increased from 300 percent of a low-
income member country’s quota (net of scheduled 
repayments) to 435 percent. Access in excess of these limits 
can be approved in certain circumstances. The temporary 
increases in the annual and cumulative access limits for PRG Trust financing, which were approved in response to the 
crisis resulting from the CO VID-19 pandemic, expired on 
December 31, 2021. The annual access limit had beenincome member country’s quota (net of scheduled 
repayments) to 435 percent. Access in excess of these limits 
can be approved in certain circumstances. The temporary 
increases in the annual and cumulative access limits for PRG Trust financing, which were approved in response to the 
crisis resulting from the CO VID-19 pandemic, expired on 
December 31, 2021. The annual access limit had been 
temporarily increased from 100 to 150 percent of quota for 
the period July 13, 2020, thro ugh April 6, 2021, and further 
increased to 245 percent of quota during the period March 
22, 2021 through December 31, 2021. In addition, the 
cumulative access limit had been increased from 300 percent 
to 435 percent of quota (net of  scheduled repayments) for the 
period April 7, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and allowed to continue thereafter until the Executive Board’s next full review of concessional lending policies. 
The temporary increase in the annual limit for RCF 
disbursements from 50 percent to 100 percent of quota for the Exogenous Shock window expired on December 31, 
2021, having been effective since April 6, 2020, as did the 
increase in the annual limit from 80 percent to 130 percent of quota for the RCF Large Natural Disaster window. The 
temporary increase in the cumulative access limit from 
100 percent to 150 percent of quota (net of scheduled repayments) for the RCF Exogenous Shock window remains 
in effect until end-June 2023, as does the temporary increase 
in the cumulative access limit from 133.33 percent to 
183.33 percent of quota (net of scheduled repayments) for 
the RCF Large Natural Disaster window. The rule of limiting 
the number of RCF disbursements (no more than two 
disbursements in a 12-month period) was reinstated on 
January 1, 2022, following a susp ension from July,13, 2021, 
to December 31, 2021.III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 87 The IMF, as Trustee, can approve access in excess of these 
limits in cases where the member is experiencing an 
exceptionally large balance of payments need and has a 
comparatively strong adjust ment program, among other 
conditions. There were no arrangements with exceptional 
access approved during the financial years ended April 30, 
2022 and April 30, 2021.  
Disbursements under PRG Trust arrangements are made in tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, structural benchmarks, and prior 
actions, as well as regular reviews by the IMF as Trustee.  
In addition, the IMF, as Trustee, has adopted a safeguards 
policy to mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a 
misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or 
performance against any conditions under a program supported by a PRG Trust arrangement. Safeguards 
assessments of borrowing member countries’ central banks 
are undertaken to provide the Trustee with reasonable assurance that the centra l banks’ legal structure, 
governance, control, reportin g, and auditing systems are 
adequate to maintain the integr ity of its operations and to 
measure resources, including PRG Trust disbursements. When PRG Trust resources are provided as direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also 
requires that disbursements be deposited at the central bank, 
and that an appropriate framework agreement between the 
central bank and the government be in place to ensure timely 
servicing of the member country’s financial obligations to the 
PRG Trust. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of a state treasury is required for cases where a member country 
requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of 
financing provided by the PRG Trust is expected to be used 
for direct budget financing.  
4.2.1.2  Credit risk exposure 
The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of 
the PRG Trust’s loans receivable and undrawn lending 
commitments, which was SDR 18,658 million and SDR 14,748 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
Loans receivable amounted to SDR 14,788 million and 
SDR 12,622 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The concentration of PRG Trust outstanding loans by region 
was as follows: 
 April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 
 (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage 
of total outstanding loans) 
Africa 10,673 72.2% 9,524 75.4% 
Asia and Pacific 1,189 8.0% 1,245 9.9% 
Europe 121 0.8% 110 0.9% 
Middle East and Central Asia 2,412 16.3% 1,380 10.9% 
Western Hemisphere 393 2.7% 363 2.9% 
Total 14,788 100.0% 12,622 100.0% 
The use of credit in the PRG Trust by the largest users was 
as follows: 
 April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 
 (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage

4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than 
investments 
Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value of futu re cash flows 
of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and 
exchange rate risk.  
4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will 
fluctuate because of changes in  market interest rates. The 
PRG Trust’s subsidy resources consist of contributions and 
investment earnings to cover the interest shortfall arising 
from the difference between the market-based interest rate 
paid on the borrowings in the Loan Accounts and the 
concessional interest rate, if any, applicable to loans receivable. Should such resources be deemed inadequate 
for this purpose, the PRG Trust instrument allows for an 
increase in the interest rate levied on outstanding loans and a transfer of investment income from the Reserve Account to 
the General Subsidy Account, subject to consultations withIII. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
88 all creditors to the Loan Accounts on the adequacy of the 
Reserve Account to protect their claims. 
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
The PRG Trust is impacted by the retirement of LIBOR as 
certain borrowing agreements in the Loan Accounts include 
an interest rate that uses LIBOR as a component of its 
computation (LIBOR-based interest rate). The PRG Trust also holds certain derivatives that are priced using LIBOR. 
These derivatives are held for the purposes of managing 
market risks (see Note 4.3.2).  
In connection with its resource mobilization efforts for lending 
(see Note 4.2.3.1), the IMF, as Trustee of the PRG Trust, 
agreed to amend borrowing agreements with various lenders 
by replacing LIBOR-based interest rate in these agreements 
with the SDR interest rate during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  
At April 30, 2022, there were no PRG Trust Loan Account 
borrowings accruing interest at  LIBOR-based interest rates 
(SDR 1,216 million at April 30, 2021).  
At April 30, 2022, the PRG Trus t’s currency swaps that were 
priced using three-month Brit ish pound and US dollar LIBOR 
had a fair value of SDR 2 million and a notional value of 
SDR 46 million (fair value of SDR 1 million and notional value of SDR 114 million at April 30, 2021). These currency swaps 
will mature before the retirement dates of three-month British 
pound and US dollar LIBOR, which are currently set for end-
June 2023. 
4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk 
Exchange rate risk is the risk that the Trusts’ financial position and cash flows will be affected by fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates. The exchange rate risk of 
the Trusts is mitigated by denom inating all assets, liabilities, 
receipts, and payments in SDRs. 
4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other 
than investments 
Liquidity risk is the risk of nonav ailability of resources to meet 
the financing needs of low-inco me member countries and the 
Trusts’ own obligations.  
4.2.3.1  Liquidity management 
The IMF, as Trustee, conducts regular reviews to determine the adequacy of resources in the Trusts to provide financial 
assistance to eligible IMF members and to meet the Trusts’ 
obligations.  
The PRG Trust must have financing available to meet low-
income member countries’ demand for credit. Uncertainties 
in the timing and amount of credit extended expose the PRG 
Trust to liquidity risk. Moreov er, the PRG Trust must also 
stand ready to provide funds for unexpected needs, for example, to authorize drawings to meet demands for 
encashment of creditor claims under the Loan Accounts’ 
borrowings (see Note 4.2.3.2).  
These financing needs are met by the PRG Trust Loan 
Accounts’ borrowings (see Note 7). Amounts available under 
borrowing and note purchase agreements in the PRG Trust 
Loan Accounts were SDR 23,091 million and 
SDR 21,380 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively 
(see also Schedule 3). Should such resources be deemed inadequate for this purpose, the PRG Trust has measures to 
cover the shortfall, as m entioned in Note 4.2.2.1. 
The PRG Trust has a cumulative borrowing limit, established 
by the Executive Board, to ensure that the IMF, as Trustee of 
the PRG Trust, does not enter into borrowing agreements 
above the limit for the PRG Tr ust Loan Accounts without prior 
consultation with PRG Trust creditors regarding the 
justification for such borrowi ng and the adequacy of the PRG 
Trust Reserve Account. In response to increased financing 
needs for lending in the PRG Trust brought about by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the PRG Trust’s cumulative borrowing 
limit has increased to SDR 68, 000 million, as of July 14, 
2021, from SDR 38,000 million in April 2020.

Fundraising efforts for both trusts are currently underway to 
ensure they remain adequately resourced.  
4.2.3.2  Maturity profile of loans and borrowings 
The repayment terms of PRG Trust loans are 5½ to 10 years 
for the ECF, ESF, and RCF and 4 to 8 years for the SCF, in 
equal semiannual installments. Scheduled repayments of

 89 The repayment periods for the PRG Trust Loan Accounts’ 
borrowings typically match the maturity of the loans extended 
by the PRG Trust. Drawings under some PRG Trust 
borrowing agreements in the Loan Accounts may have shorter initial maturities (e.g., six months) that can be 
extended, at the sole discretio n of the Trustee, up to the 
maturity dates of the corresponding Trust loans for which they were drawn. 
The borrowings of the PRG Trust Subsidy Accounts are

4.3  Investments  
Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 
4.3.1  Credit risk on investments 
Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if 
issuers and counterparties were to default on their 
contractual obligations. 
4.3.1.1  Credit risk management practices 
PRG Trust Investments Credit risk is managed by limiting fixed-income investments 
to financial instruments with a credit rating equivalent to at 
least BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s rating scale) for corporate bonds (minor holdings of corporate bonds of lower 
quality could be held by the in vestment managers if their 
credit rating has decreased below BBB– subsequent to 
acquisition), and BBB+  or higher for other fixed-income 
investments (government bonds and official-sector fixed-income investments), except for instruments issued by the 
Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which do not have a 
credit rating, central bank deposits, and uninvested cash balances (short-term investments). Counterparty risk for 
derivative instruments is mitiga ted by strict exposure limits, 
credit rating requirements, and collateral requirements.  
PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts’ Investments  
Credit risk is minimized by limiting eligible investments to 
marketable securities rated at least A (based on Standard & Poor’s rating scale). Eligible investments include high-quality 
short-duration fixed-income securities, which includecredit rating requirements, and collateral requirements.  
PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts’ Investments  
Credit risk is minimized by limiting eligible investments to 
marketable securities rated at least A (based on Standard & Poor’s rating scale). Eligible investments include high-quality 
short-duration fixed-income securities, which include 
marketable obligations issued by: (i) national governments of members, their central banks,  or their national official 
institutions; and (ii) internatio nal financial organizations, and 
deposits with a commercial bank, national official financial 
institution of a member, or  an international financial 
institution, incl uding the BIS.III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
90 4.3.1.2  Credit risk exposure 
The carrying value of the fixed-income instruments and short-
term investments represents the maximum exposure to credit 
risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized gains on such 
contracts.  
The credit risk exposure for fixed-income instruments and 
short-term investments in the PRG Trust at the end of the 
respective reporting periods was as follows: 
 April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021 
 (as a percentage of total fixed-income 
instruments and short-term investments) 
BIS obligations (not rated) 26.7 26.7 
AAA 10.8 7.4 
AA+ to AA– 19.3 22.0 
A+ to A– 26.7 28.4 
BBB+ to BBB– 16.5 15.5 
Total 100.0 100.0 
 
The credit risk exposure for the PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts’ 
investments was limited to BIS obligations that are not rated 
and amounted to SDR 301 million and SDR 61 million at April 30, 2022, respectively (SDR 301 million and 
SDR 18 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021). 
The credit risk exposure for derivative assets in the PRG 
Trust amounted to SDR 10 million and SDR 12 million, 
respectively, at April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
4.3.2  Market risk on investments 
Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value of futu re cash flows 
of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in 
market price. The investment objectives and strategies of the 
Trusts, including asset allocation and risk tolerance (see 
Note 5), expose the Trusts’ investments to market risk. These risks include interest rate  risk, exchange rate risk, and 
other price risks.  
PRG Trust investments  
The market risks on the PRG Tr ust investment portfolio are 
mitigated by: (i) ensuring divers ification at the portfolio level 
through a target asset allocation and within asset class components through concentration and exposure limits; 
(ii) setting duration limits for fixed-income components; (iii) aligning or hedging the currency exposure of short-term 
investments, short-duration fixed-income securities, and 
corporate bonds with the SDR currency basket; and (iv) permitting the use of derivatives for managing interest 
rate and exchange rate risks.  
PRG-HIPC and CCR Trust investments 
The market risks on the PRG-HIPC and CCR Trust 
investment portfolios are mitigated by: (i) setting duration limits for fixed-income components and (ii) rebalancing the portfolios periodically. Fixed-term and demand deposits held 
in the Trusts’ investment portfo lios are denominated in SDRs 
and carry a fixed rate of intere st or the SDR interest rate. 
4.3.2.1  Value at Risk Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange 
rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which 
considers known market risks in each of the asset categories 
and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates reported below represent the maximum potential loss in 
value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market 
movements, with a 95 percent conf idence level. There is a 1 
in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year 
could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount. 
The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a 
three-year lookback period, and monthly overlapping risk 
factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios to produce plausible future scenarios based on these 
simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on 
the valuation date is shocked according to past observations 
and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical 
distribution of returns. There is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk 
characteristics of the in vestments involves many 
assumptions and approximations. Different assumptions orthe valuation date is shocked according to past observations 
and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical 
distribution of returns. There is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk 
characteristics of the in vestments involves many 
assumptions and approximations. Different assumptions or 
approximations would produce significantly different VaR 
estimates.

Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an 
investment will not have an active buyer or seller when traded, which could negatively affect the price of the 
investment.  
4.3.3.1  Liquidity management The liquidity position of each Trust is closely monitored by 
maintaining liquidity projections to ensure day-to-day 
servicing needs are met. To minimize the risk of loss from liquidating investments, the Trusts hold resources in readily 
marketable short-term financial instruments to meet 
anticipated liquidity needs.III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021

5.  Investments 
5.1  PRG Trust investments 
The guidelines for investing PRG Trust assets provide for an 
investment strategy that is geared toward generating a 
nominal net-of-fees return of 90 basis points above the SDR interest rate over time. The PR G Trust assets are invested in 
a diversified portfolio of a range  of fixed-income instruments 
and equity securities.   
The Executive Board approved amendments to the 
investment guidelines of the PRG Trust on January 12, 2022. 
The amendments, which will be implemented during the 
financial year ending April 30, 2023, include the following: 
 Reallocation within the PRG Trust’s target asset 
allocation —the corporate bond component will be 15 
percent (previously 30 percent), and the liquidity and 
short-duration fixed-income components will be 60 percent 
(previously 45 percent); 
 Changes in eligible investments —Under the PRG 
Trust’s revised investment guidelines, the short-duration 
fixed-income component shall consist of two tranches, an actively managed shorter-duration Tranche 1 and a buy-and-hold longer-duration Tranc he 2, which will together 
have a maximum average duration of three years. Both 
tranches can be invested in a range of fixed-income 
securities.

The changes in loans receivable reflect emergency financing under the RCF that was provided by the PRG Trust to 
low-income member countries that faced urgent balance of 
payments needs as a result of the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Outstanding loans by members are 
presented in Schedule 1.
 
6.3  Impairment analysis 
The PRG Trust has performed an impairment analysis of its portfolio of loans receivable in accordance with its ECL 
model (see Note 3.2.3). Based on this analysis, no loss 
allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022, and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.3, the impairment 
analysis of the PRG Trust’s outstanding loans takes into 
account the unique nature of the PRG Trust’s financing and institutional status of the IMF,  as Trustee. The analysis was 
performed holistically for each debtor member based on qualitative and quantit ative considerations, taking into 
account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.4. In this context, the results of the PRG Trust’s 
impairment analysis at April 30, 2022, and 2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in input parameters of the ECL calculation. 
6.4  Interest on loans receivable 
The interest rate applicable to outstanding PRG Trust loans was zero for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 
2021. 
 
The interest rates on PRG Trust lending are reviewed every 
two years by the Executive Board. The interest rates are set for the upcoming two years and are based on the average 
SDR interest rate for the latest 12-month period. The last 
review of the PRG Trust’s lending interest rates was 
completed on July 14, 2021, and the interest rate was kept at 
zero percent for all PRG Trust outstanding loans until end-July 2023 based on the interest rate structure in the table below:

 93 7.  Borrowings 
The Trusts borrow on such terms and conditions as agreed 
between the Trustee and individual lenders.  
Borrowings in the PRG Trust Loan Accounts provide 
resources for on-lending to low-income member countries. 
Commitments made by lenders to the PRG Trust Loan 
Accounts are nonrevolving and subject to a time limit. 
Creditors to the PRG Trus t may earmark their loan 
commitments for a specific Loan Account (ECF, SCF, or 
RCF) or make them generally available for any loan facility. 
Proceeds from borrowings in the PRG Trust’s Subsidy Accounts and Deposit and Investment Account, the PRG-
HIPC Trust, and CCR Trust are invested and generate net 
investment income. This income  contributes to the resources 
for operational use in the respective Trusts.

CCR Trust borrowings are interest free. 
8.  Contributions 
The Trusts’ operations are financ ed primarily by contributions 
provided by a broad segment of IMF member countries and 
other donors, as well as cont ributions from the Special 
Disbursement Account and Admi nistered Accounts, on behalf 
of IMF member countries. These contributions are mobilized and managed under the PRG Trust for concessional lending 
and under the PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts for debt relief.  Contributions comprised the following:

9.  Debt relief assistance 
9.1  Response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
On April 13, 2020, the Executiv e Board approved an initiative 
for the IMF, as Trustee of the CCR Trust to provide financial 
assistance, in the form of grants, to 29 member countries 
impacted by the COVID-19 pand emic. On October 6, 2021, 
two additional member countries became CCR Trust-eligible. 
The initiative was completed during the financial year ended 
April 30, 2022, and assisted member countries to make debt 
service payments on their eligible debt falling due from April 14, 2020, to April 13, 2022. Fo llowing the Executive Board’s 
approval, the grants were tran sferred from the CCR Trust 
Accounts to the CCR Trust Umbrella Account, where debt 
relief assistance was disbursed and recognized as an 
expense. 
During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the Executive 
Board approved for the IMF, as  Trustee of the CCR Trust, to 
provide financial assistance by disbursing two tranches of 
grants, resulting in the recognition of debt relief assistance 
amounting to SDR 171 million (disbursement of two tranchesrelief assistance was disbursed and recognized as an 
expense. 
During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the Executive 
Board approved for the IMF, as  Trustee of the CCR Trust, to 
provide financial assistance by disbursing two tranches of 
grants, resulting in the recognition of debt relief assistance 
amounting to SDR 171 million (disbursement of two tranches 
for SDR 354 million during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). The debt relief assistance was applied toward eligible 
debt service payments for member countries with eligible 
debt in the GRA and the PRG Trust. Cumulative debt relief 
assistance disbursed by the CCR Trust at April 30, 2022, by 
member country and by tranche, is presented in Schedule 5.III. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
94 9.2  HIPC Initiative  
In 1996, the IMF and the World Bank jointly launched the 
HIPC Initiative to help relieve the external debt burden for 
several eligible member countries. The HIPC Initiative 
involves coordinated action by the international financial community, including multilateral institutions, to reduce the 
external debt burden of these member countries to 
sustainable levels. At April 30, 2022, 36 of 39 member 
countries eligible or potentially eligible for HIPC Initiative 
assistance have received grants for debt relief, in full, from the IMF, as Trustee of the PRG-HIPC Trust. Of the three 
remaining cases, Somalia and Sudan have made progress under the initiative (see below). The remaining member country, Eritrea, has no debt that is eligible for HIPC Initiative 
assistance at April 30, 2022. 
Somalia and Sudan  
The Executive Board determined that Somalia and Sudan 
were eligible and qualified for debt relief assistance under the HIPC Initiative on March 25, 2020, and June 29, 2021, 
respectively. Both member countries’ future debt reduction 
under the HIPC Initiative is contingent on meeting specific 
criteria.  
The Executive Board approved a grant for interim debt relief 
assistance to Sudan amounting to SDR 1 million during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (SDR 1 million to Somalia 
during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). These grants 
for Somalia and Sudan were recognized as contributions in 
the PRG-HIPC Trust and were financed by transfers from the 
Somalia Administered Account and Sudan Administered Account, respectively (see Note 8). During the financial years 
ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, debt relief assistance 
amounting to SDR 1 million and SDR 1 million was recognized as an expense when Somalia’s and Sudan’s debt 
service payments eligible under the HIPC Initiative fell due.  
10.  Fair value measurement  
Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments 
include the following: 
Level 1 
The fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on 
quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets 
without any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and 
derivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income 
securities). These investments are included within Level 1 of 
the fair value hierarchy. 
Level 2  
The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not 
actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of 
significant observable market information, such  as recently executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into 
account the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable, these securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value 
hierarchy. 
The fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments 
(foreign exchange forwards and currency swaps) not actively 
traded is determined using a pricing model that incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate 
curves. Given that the signific ant inputs into the pricing 
models are market-observabl e, these instruments are 
included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy . 
10.1  Investments  
The following tables present the fair value hierarchy used to 
determine the fair value of investments in the PRG and PRG-HIPC Trusts:

There were no Level 3 invest ments at April 30, 2022, and

During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments 
totaling SDR 9 million were transferred from Level 1 into

There were no Level 3 invest ments at April 30, 2022, and 
2021. 
During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments 
totaling SDR 9 million were transferred from Level 1 into 
Level 2 (there were no transfers between levels during the 
financial year ended April 30, 2021). These investments 
relate to equity secu rities where trading was either inactive or 
quoted prices in the applicabl e market were not observable 
as at April 30, 2022. Quoted pr ices for similar securities 
directly observable in an alternative market were used for fair value measurement of these securi ties as at April 30, 2022.  
There were no transfers between Levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
Investments in fixed-term and demand deposits are generally 
of a short-term nature and are carried at amortized cost, 
which approximates fair value. 
Based on the fair value hierarchy, SDR 1 million in derivative 
liabilities was categorized as Level 1 and SDR 26 million as 
Level 2 at April 30, 2022 (SDR 1 million and SDR 7 million, 
respectively, at April 30, 2021). There were no Level 3 derivative liabilities and no transfers of derivative liabilitiesIII. Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021

April 30, 2022, and 2021.  
10.2  Loans receivable  
The PRG Trust, and the IMF as Trustee, plays a unique role in providing balance of payments support to member countries. PRG Trust financing features policy conditions that 
require member countries to implement macroeconomic and 
structural policies, and are an integral part of PRG Trust 
lending. These measures aim to help member countries solve their balance of payments problems while safeguarding Trust resources. The fair value of PRG Trust loans receivable 
as defined under IFRS 13 cannot be determined due to their 
unique characteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, the Trustee, and the absence of a 
principal or most advantageous market for PRG Trust loans.  
10.3  Other financial assets and liabilities 
The carrying value of borrowings and other assets and liabilities accounted for at amortized cost, except derivative 
liabilities, represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value 
at April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
11.  Related party transactions 
The expenses of conducting the business of the Trusts are 
paid by the GRA. At the end of each financial year, certain of 
the Trusts may reimburse the GRA in accordance with the 
IMF’s Articles of Agreement and relevant decisions of the 
Executive Board. On July 14,  2021, the Executive Board 
approved a suspension of the reimbursement by the PRG 
Trust to the GRA for financial years 2022 to 2026. As a 
result, the estimated reimbursement of SDR 76 million by the 
PRG Trust to the GRA was forgone during the financial year  ended April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, the Executive Board approved a waiver of the 
reimbursement estimated at SDR 87 million. 
There were no reimbursements to the GRA from the 
PRG-HIPC and CCR Trusts during the financial years ended 
April 30, 2022, and 2021. 
In addition to bilateral contributions from member countries, 
the IMF also made contributions to the Trusts to meet the 
financing needs of low-income member countries. Cumulative contributions from  the IMF were as follows: 
During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the PRG Trust Reserve Account received SDR 84 million in contributions from the IMF thr ough the SDA (no contributions 
received from the IMF during the financial year ended April 30, 2021).

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our 
responsibil ities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International 
Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant 
ethical requirements relating to our audits,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United 
States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.  
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordanc e with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Administered 
Accounts’ ability to continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twe lve months from the end 
of the reporting period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Administered Accounts  or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Administered Accounts ’ financial 
reporting process.  
 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
   
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and 
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material 
if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment 
made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we: 
 
● Exercise professional judgment and maintain profession al skepticism throughout the audit.  
● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such 
procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements.  
● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpo se of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Administered Accounts’  internal control. Accordingly, no such 
opinion is expressed.   
● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.  
● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, 
that raise substantial doubt about the Administered Accounts’ ab ility to continue as a going 
concern for a reasonable period of time.  
 
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain inte rnal control -related 
matters that we identified during the audit. 
 
Supplemental Information  
 
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on each of the financial statements 
taken as a whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 126 to 132 as of April 30, 
2022 and for the periods indicated above (collective ly referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are 
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the respective Administered 
Account’s financial statements.  The supplemental schedules are the responsibility of management and  
were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
respective Administered Account’s financial statements. The information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the res pective Administered Account’s financial statements 
and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the respective Administered Account’s financ ial 
statements or to the financial statements themselves and other additional procedures, in accordance with 
US GAAS. We also subjected the information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs.  In our 
opinion, the supplemental schedules are fairly sta ted, in all material respects, in relation to the respective 
Administered Account’s financial statements taken as a whole.

April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 1.  Nature of operations 
At the request of its members,  the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) has established special-purpose accounts (the 
Administered Accounts) to administer resources contributed 
for financial and technical services consistent with the purposes of the IMF. The instruments establishing the 
Administered Accounts provide t he terms and conditions, as 
agreed with the IMF and contri buting members, under which 
the resources may be used. The assets and liabilities of each account and each subaccount are separate from the assets 
and liabilities of all other accounts of, or administered by, the 
IMF. The assets of each account and each subaccount are 
not to be used to discharge liabilities or to cover losses incurred in the administration of other accounts. 
1.1  Technical Assistance and Special Purpose 
Accounts 
1.1.1  Supplementary Financi ng Facility Subsidy Account 
(SFF Subsidy) 
The account was established in December 1980 to assist low-income member countries to meet the costs of using 
resources made available through the IMF’s Supplementary 
Financing Facility and under the policy on exceptional 
access. All repurchases under these policies were due on or 
before January 31, 1991, and the final subsidy payments 
were approved in July 1991. One member (Sudan), overdue 
in the payment of charges to the General Department of the 
IMF at April 30, 2021, remained eligible to receive previously 
approved subsidy payments of SDR 0.9 million.  
On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled its overdue charges in the 
General Department, and the account was terminated. On August 1, 2021, the account was liquidated upon completion 
of the subsidy operations. 
1.1.2  Administered Account—People’s Bank of China 
(People’s Bank of China) 
The account was established in June 2012 to administer and invest resources provided by the People’s Bank of China to 
support the IMF’s technical assistance and training 
programs. During the financial year ended April 30, 2018, the 
instrument governing the account was amended to extend 
the termination date of the acc ount to October 1, 2022. The 
account will be terminated upon completion of operations, or 
at such earlier time by the IMF in consultation with the 
People’s Bank of China. Once  the obligation to repay the 
outstanding deposit has been discharged and the final payment of interest has been made, any surplus remaining in the account will be transferred to the People’s Bank of China. 
1.1.3  Somalia Administered Account (Somalia) 
The account was established in December 2019 to facilitate 
fundraising for, and delivery of, debt relief to Somalia in 
respect of obligations owed to the IMF. The resources of the 
account consist of contributions by donors and are to be 
used in the context of deliv ering Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries (HIPC) Init iative debt relief, as well as to provide 
additional debt relief to Somalia beyond-HIPC assistance once Somalia reaches the HIPC completion point. The 
account shall remain in effect for as long as is necessary to 
conduct the business of the account. Any balances remaining in the account on the date of  its termination and after the 
discharge of all obligations of the account shall be transferred 
to the PRG-HIPC Trust for use in accordance with the 
provisions of the PRG-HIPC Trust Instrument provided that, at the request of any contribut or, the contributor’s pro rata 
share of any such resources remaining in the account, or any portion of such share, shall be returned to the contributor. 
1.1.4  Administered Account for Sudan (Sudan) 
The account was established in May 2021 to facilitate 
fundraising for, and delivery of, debt relief to Sudan in 
respect of obligations owed to the IMF. The resources of theshare of any such resources remaining in the account, or any portion of such share, shall be returned to the contributor. 
1.1.4  Administered Account for Sudan (Sudan) 
The account was established in May 2021 to facilitate 
fundraising for, and delivery of, debt relief to Sudan in 
respect of obligations owed to the IMF. The resources of the 
account consist of contributions by donors and are to be 
used in the context of delivering HIPC debt relief, as well as 
to provide additional debt relief to Sudan beyond-HIPC 
assistance once Sudan reaches the HIPC completion point. The account shall remain in effect for as long as is necessary 
to conduct the business of the account. Any balances 
remaining in the account on the date of its termination and after the discharge of all obligat ions of the account shall be 
transferred to the PRG-HIPC Trust for use in accordance with the provisions of the PRG-HIPC Trust Instrument 
provided that, at the request of any contributor, the 
contributor’s pro rata share of any such resources remaining 
in the account, or any portion of such share, shall be returned 
to the contributor. 
1.1.5  Administered Account for Ukraine (Ukraine) 
The account was established in April 2022 to channel 
resources in the form of grants and loans from members, 
their official institutions, and intergovernmental agencies and organizations (together referred to as “donors”) to assist 
Ukraine in meeting its balanc e of payments and budgetary 
needs in order to help stab ilize its economy. While the 
account may hold resources provided by donors, it is set upIV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
118 to primarily operate as a pass-through vehicle. Accordingly, 
grants, loans, repayments, an d interest payments received 
into the account are expected to be disbursed or transferred promptly when instructed by a donor. The account may be 
terminated at any time by the IMF or by a unanimous 
decision of all existing donors. Any balances remaining in the 
account on the date of its termination and after the discharge 
of all obligations of the acc ount shall be transferred promptly 
to donors in line with their contributions. Each donor may 
instruct that all or a spec ified amount be transferred to 
Ukraine, or be utilized for such other purposes as may be mutually agreed between the donor and the IMF. 
In June 2022, the Government of Canada disbursed through 
the account a 1 billion Canadian dollars loan (SDR 585,764 
thousand) to Ukraine. 
1.1.6  Administered Account—Japan (Japan) 
The account was established in March 1989 to administer 
resources provided by Japan—and, under a subsequent amendment, by other countries with Japan’s concurrence—
that are to be used to assist certain members with overdue 
obligations to the IMF. The resources of the account are to 
be disbursed in amounts specified by Japan and to members 
designated by Japan. Effective March 5, 2008, the instrument governing the account was amended to allow the provision of 
assistance to these member s in the context of an 
internationally agreed comprehensive package that 
integrates arrears clearance and subsequent debt relief. 
Effective April 9, 2020, the inst rument governing the account 
was further amended to enable Japan to support a broader 
range of IMF activities, including contributing to debt relief 
under the Catastrophe Containm ent and Relief (CCR) Trust. 
The account can be terminated by the IMF or at the request of Japan at any time. Upon termination of the account, any 
remaining resources in the account are to be returned to Japan. 
1.1.7  Framework Administered Account for Selected Fund 
Activities (Framework—SFA) The account was established in March 2009 to administer 
externally contributed resources that are to be used to 
finance selected IMF activities, including the full range of IMF technical assistance activities provided to recipients. 
 
The financing of selected IMF activities is implemented through the establishment and  operation of subaccounts 
within the Framework—SFA. At April 30, 2022, there were 
47 subaccounts; no new subaccounts were established during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (one during the 
financial year ended April 30, 2021); and no subaccounts 
were terminated during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (three during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). 
Disbursements are made from the respective subaccounts 
under the Framework—SFA to the General Resources Account to reimburse the IMF for costs incurred in connection with activities financed by the respective 
subaccounts. Framework—SFA resources are to be used in 
accordance with terms and conditions established by the IMF, with the concurrence of contributors. Resources in 
Framework—SFA subaccounts may be transferred to other subaccounts if the terms and c onditions of the subaccounts 
so provide. 
The Framework—SFA may be terminated by the IMF at any 
time with the concurrence of all contributors and the 
Managing Director. A subaccount may also be terminated at the request of the contributor to the subaccount or, in the 
case of a subaccount comprising resources from more than 
one contributor, by all the cont ributors participating in the 
subaccount at the time of termination. Contributors may 
cease participation in a subac count at any time withoutManaging Director. A subaccount may also be terminated at the request of the contributor to the subaccount or, in the 
case of a subaccount comprising resources from more than 
one contributor, by all the cont ributors participating in the 
subaccount at the time of termination. Contributors may 
cease participation in a subac count at any time without 
termination of the subaccount. The disposition of any balances, net of liabilities and commitments under the activities financed, is governed by the conditions agreed 
between the IMF and the contri butor(s). Absent such 
agreement, the balances are returned to the contributor(s) upon withdrawal from or termination of the subaccount. 
1.1.8  Administered Account—Switzerland (Switzerland) 
The account was established in  February 2017 to facilitate 
the settlement of payments u nder the bilateral financing 
agreement between the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). The account was 
terminated on March 3, 2022, upon the NBU’s repayment in 
full of the outstanding obligat ions and termination of the 
bilateral loan agreement. 
1.2  Interim Holdings of Resources Accounts 
1.2.1  Framework Interim A ccount (Framewo rk Interim) 
The account was established in December 2019 to receive and hold any resources of participants, pending instructions of each participant as to the disposition of its share of such 
resources. The establishment of a Framework Interim 
Account, with subaccounts for specific initiatives, aims to reduce costs and streamline t he administration of such 
resources. Resources for each subaccount are to be administered separately within the Framework Interim Account. At April 30, 2022, there were 7 subaccounts;  one 
new subaccount was established during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 (one during the financial year ended 
April 30, 2021). The account (and any subaccount) can be 
terminated by the IMF at any time. At termination any remaining balances will be repaid in full to participants.IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 119 1.2.2  Administered Account for Interim Holdings of Voluntary 
Contributions for Fund Activities (Voluntary Contributions) 
The account was established in April 2010 to receive and 
hold externally contributed resources for an interim period until such time as they can be transferred to other Trusts or 
accounts administered by the IMF. The resources deposited 
into the Interim Holdings Account will ultimately fund activities 
for which understandings or modalities to use those 
resources are not yet finalized. The account may be terminated by the IMF at any time, and uncommitted 
resources in the account at the time of termination are to be 
returned to the contri butors. There were no balances in this 
account at April 30, 2022, and 2021, and no transactions for 
the financial years then ended.  
2.  Basis of preparation and measurement 
The financial statements of t he Administered Accounts are 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments 
at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements 
have also been prepared on the basis that the Administered 
Accounts will continue to operate as a going concern, except 
for the SFF Subsidy and Switzerland Administered Accounts, 
which were terminated during the financial year ended April 
30, 2022. 
2.1  Unit of account 
2.1.1  Japan, Framework—SFA, Switzerland, and Voluntary 
Contributions 
The functional and reporting currency of these accounts is 
the US dollar. All transacti ons and operations of these 
accounts, including the transfers to and from these accounts 
and interest payments, are denominated in US dollars. 
Contributions denominated in other currencies are converted 
into US dollars upon receipt of the funds. 
2.1.2  SFF Subsidy, People’s Bank of China, Somalia, 
Sudan, Ukraine, and Framework Interim 
The financial statements for these accounts are presented in SDRs in accordance with the terms of these accounts. The 
SDR is the IMF’s unit of account. Its value is determined daily 
by the IMF by summing spec ific amounts of the basket 
currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. Contributions denominated in other currencies are converted into the component currencies in 
the SDR basket upon receipt of the funds.  
The IMF generally reviews the composition of the SDR 
valuation basket at five-year intervals.  
The weights and amounts of the currencies in the SDR 
basket, effective October 1, 2016, were as follows: 
SDR basket 
currency  Weight (in percent) Amount 
Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174 
Euro 30.93 0.38671 
Japanese yen 8.33   11.900 
Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946 
US dollar  41.73 0.58252 
At April 30, 2022, one SDR was equal to US$1.34430 
(US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  
The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled 
to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the IMF 
Executive Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  
On May 11, 2022, the IMF Ex ecutive Board concluded the 
quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR 
and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR 
currency and interest rate baskets and approved their 
updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher 
weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, 
accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, 
the euro, and the Japanese yen.  
Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket 
will be assigned the following weights:  
SDR basket currency Weight (in percent) 
Chinese renminbi 12.28 
Euro 29.31 
Japanese yen 7.59 
Pound sterling 7.44 
US dollar  43.38weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and, 
accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound, 
the euro, and the Japanese yen.  
Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket 
will be assigned the following weights:  
SDR basket currency Weight (in percent) 
Chinese renminbi 12.28 
Euro 29.31 
Japanese yen 7.59 
Pound sterling 7.44 
US dollar  43.38 
 
The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated 
on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the 
new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of 
the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the 
interim justify an earlier review.IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
120 2.2  SDR interest rate 
The SDR interest rate is used to calculate interest income on 
resources held in SDRs.  
The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a 
weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments 
in the money markets of the members whose currencies are 
included in the SDR valuation basket as follows:  
SDR basket currency Yield or rate 
Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China 
Treasury bonds as published by the China 
Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd. 
Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central 
government bonds with a minimum rating of 
AA published by the European Central Bank 
Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills 
Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills 
US dollar Three-month Treasury bills 
 
The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent and is rounded to three decimal places. The average 
SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum and 
0.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
2.3  Use of estimates and judgement 
The preparation of financ ial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates, and 
assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and 
in any future pe riods affected.  
The most significant estimates and judgements used in applying accounting policies include fair value measurement 
of financial instruments (see Note 3.7). 
3.  Summary of significant accounting policies 
3.1  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other highly liquid short-term investments that are readily conv ertible to a known amount of 
cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for 
investment or other purposes. 3.2  Investments 
Investments held in the People ’s Bank of China account are 
managed in accordance with the Administered Accounts’ risk management and investment strategy, and their performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis. As a result, these securities are classified at fa ir value through profit or loss 
(FVPL) in accordance with their business model. Funds pending suitable investment  in accordance with the 
investment strategy are kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are 
measured at amortized cost. The valuation techniques to determine fair value are described in Note 5. 
3.2.1  Recognition 
Investments are initially recognized on the trade date at which an account becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
3.2.2  Derecognition 
Investments are derecognize d on the trade date when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the investment are transferred. 
3.2.3  Interest and investment income 
Interest and investment income comprises interest income on 
cash and cash equivalents and investments, realized gains and losses, and unrealized gains and losses, including currency valuation differences arising from exchange rate 
movements against the functional currency. Interest income 
is recognized on an accrual basis under the effective interest method. 
3.3  Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value of the amount drawn and are subsequently m easured at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method. 
3.4  Contributions 
Contributions are recognized in  the financial statements aftermovements against the functional currency. Interest income 
is recognized on an accrual basis under the effective interest method. 
3.3  Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value of the amount drawn and are subsequently m easured at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method. 
3.4  Contributions 
Contributions are recognized in  the financial statements after 
the achievement of specified conditions and are subject to 
the bilateral agreements stipul ating how the resources are to 
be used. 
3.5  Operating expenses 
Operating expenses consist of reimbursements to the IMF for 
program and administrative costs incurred on behalf of technical assistance activities for selected accounts, as 
agreed between the IMF and contributing members to the 
Administered Accounts.  
3.6  Conversion gains/(losses) 
Conversion gains/(losses) consist of gains and losses on 
contributions received. The gains/(losses) result from the 
timing difference between the dat e contributions are receivedIV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 121 and the date of conversion of su ch contributions into the 
functional currency of the account.    
3.7  Fair value measurement 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value 
measurement is based on th e presumption that the 
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, 
in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market. 
A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair 
value under which financial instruments are categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. 
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date; 
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices); 
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset 
or liability fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level within which the fa ir value measurement is 
categorized is based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value me asurement of the instrument in 
its entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may 
include inputs that are both observable and unobservable.  
3.8  New and revised International Financial Reporting 
Standards and interpretations 
3.8.1  Amendments to existing st andards effective in future 
years 
Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial 
Statements”, and IFRS Practi ce Statement 2, “Making 
Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting 
policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The 
amendments will be adopted by the Administered Accounts 
for the financial year ending April 30, 2024, and are not 
expected to have a material effect on the Administered 
Accounts’ financial statements. 
Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February 
2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or 
after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by 
the Administered Accounts for the financial year ending April 
30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the Administered Accounts ’ financial statements.  
4.  Financial risk management  
In administering contributed resources and funding financial and technical services, the Administered Accounts have exposure to credit, liquidity, and market risks.  
4.1  Credit risk 
Credit risk on investment acti vities represents the potential 
loss that the Administered Acc ounts may incur if obligors and 
counterparties default on their c ontractual obligations. Credit 
risk is minimized by holding resources at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  an international financial 
institution that provides financ ial services to central banks 
and other international financial institutions.  
4.2  Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk of nonavailability of resources to meet 
financing needs and obligations. Liquidity risk is monitored to 
ensure that upcoming payments or transfers can be met from the Administered Accounts’ cash and highly liquid 
investments. For the People’s  Bank of China account, the 
principal resources are invested with the objective to4.2  Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk of nonavailability of resources to meet 
financing needs and obligations. Liquidity risk is monitored to 
ensure that upcoming payments or transfers can be met from the Administered Accounts’ cash and highly liquid 
investments. For the People’s  Bank of China account, the 
principal resources are invested with the objective to 
generate income to support the agreed technical assistance 
and training activities while preserving the principal in 
nominal terms. The maturity of the investments matches the repayment of the principal to the People’s Bank of China due 
in October 2022. 
4.3  Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows 
of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk includes interest rate risk and 
exchange rate risk. 
4.3.1  Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that  fair value or future net cash 
flows will fluctuate because of changes in market interest 
rates. The resources in the People’s Bank of China account 
are invested in BIS fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost, and medium-term instruments (MTIs), 
which are subject to mark-to-ma rket interest rate risk.  
4.3.2  Exchange rate risk Exchange rate risk is the risk that the entity’s financial 
position and cash flows will be affected by fluctuations in prevailing foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rate 
risk is managed, to the extent possible, by holding allIV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
122 financial assets and liabilities in the functional currency of 
each account or, in the case of accounts whose unit of 
account is the SDR, in the constituent currencies included in 
the SDR valuation basket. The exchange rate risk on investments held by the People’s Bank of China account is 
managed by investing in MTIs and fixed-term deposits 
denominated in the constituent currencies included in the 
SDR’s valuation basket with the relative amount of each 
currency matching its weight in  the SDR basket. In addition, 
the currency composition of the account is adjusted 
periodically to align with the SDR basket; therefore, exchange rate ri sk is minimal. 
4.3.3  Value at Risk 
Exposures to market risk are measured using value at risk 
(VaR). The VaR estimates reported below represent the maximum potential loss in value of the assets over the next 
year due to adverse market movements, with a 95 percent 
confidence level. There is a 1 in 20 chance that annual 
losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the 
reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the 
reported VaR by a significant amount. 
The VaR model is based on historical simulations and 
monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios to produce plausible future 
scenarios based on these simulations. In each simulation 
scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations, and each instrument is 
repriced, resulting in a hypothetical distribution of returns. 
There is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the 
investments involves many assumptions and some limited 
proxy or substitutes. Different assumptions or methodologies 
would produce significantly different VaR estimates. 
The VaR was SDR 392 thousand at April 30, 2022 
(SDR 382 thousand at April 30, 2021). 5.  Investments 
The investments of the Peopl e’s Bank of China account 
comprised the following: 
 April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021 
(in thousands of SDRs)  
Fixed-term deposits  93,419  18,885 
Medium-term instruments (BIS) 75,908  150,933 
Total 169,327  169,818 
The fixed-term deposits held at April 30, 2022, and 2021, mature in financial year 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Medium-term instruments (BIS ) held at April 30, 2022, 
mature in financial year 2023 (medium-term instruments 
(BIS) held at April 30, 2021, mature in financial years 2022 and 2023). 
BIS MTIs are not traded in an active market; consequently, 
their fair value is determined based on a compilation of 
significant observable market information such as recently 
executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable 
issuers and yield curves. The investments are categorized as 
Level 2 based on the fair value hierarchy.  
Investment income for the Administered Accounts consisted 
of interest income only, except for the People’s Bank of China account, whose investment income comprised the 
following: 
 2022 2021 
(in thousands of 
SDRs)  
Investment loss on FVPL investments (780) (357) 
Interest income on investments at amortized cost 937 773 
Total 157 416IV. Administered Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021 
 
 123 6.  Borrowings 
The People’s Bank of China account was funded by an 
SDR 170,000 thousand loan from the People’s Bank of China 
on July 2, 2012. Upon its initia l maturity on July 2, 2017, the 
loan was renewed for another five years. The interest on the loan is one-tenth of 1 perc ent per annum, payable annually, 
but only if the net investment earnings on the corresponding investment exceed that amount per annum. 
7.  Operating expenses 
The expenses of conducting the ac tivities of the Administered 
Accounts are paid by the Gene ral Department of the IMF, 
and the terms of some accounts provide for the partial reimbursements to the General  Department of the IMF for 
such expenses.  
Switzerland account reimbursements amounted to 
US$16 thousand and US$20 thousand for the financial years 
ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  
Framework—SFA account reimbursements amounted to 
US$150,590 thousand and US$126,680 thousand for the 
financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  8.  Transfers 
Transfers of resources from administered accounts during
